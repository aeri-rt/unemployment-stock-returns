# Abstract {-}

We extend Gonzalo and Taamouti (2017) to 2015-2025 with comprehensive robustness testing. Replicating their AR(15) decomposition on the full sample (1950-2025, N=907), we confirm only anticipated unemployment affects returns (β=0.22, p=0.009), while unanticipated shocks do not (β=0.02, p=0.23). However, robustness tests reveal critical limitations. First, formal Chow tests find **no structural break** at 2014 (p=0.30), though rolling windows show extreme variability (CV=98%, only 20% of windows significant). Second, Fed Put interaction tests are **inconclusive**: non-significant coefficient (β=-0.08, p=0.23) with only 23% statistical power and wide confidence intervals prevent definitive conclusions. Third, the relationship has **negligible explanatory power** (in-sample R²<1%) and **no predictive ability** (OOS R²=-0.7%). Fourth, variance decomposition shows market volatility (VIX) explains 94% of R² versus unemployment's 6%. Permutation tests confirm statistical genuineness, but economic significance is trivial. These findings demonstrate the unemployment-return relationship is detectable yet characterized by extreme temporal instability, underpowered mechanism tests, and zero forecasting value. We emphasize transparent reporting of null and inconclusive results and discuss how low signal-to-noise ratios can produce overstated conclusions in macro-finance research.

# Introduction

## Research Motivation and Context

The relationship between labor market conditions and equity valuations presents a puzzle: traditional theory predicts rising unemployment should depress stock returns, yet empirical evidence often shows the opposite. Boyd, Hu, and Jagannathan (2005) document state-dependent reactions across business cycles, while Gonzalo and Taamouti (2017) provide the theoretical foundation. Using data from 1950-2014, they demonstrate that only **anticipated** unemployment—the component forecastable from past data—affects stock returns (β≈0.22, statistically significant), while unanticipated shocks have no significant impact. They attribute this association to Federal Reserve policy responses: markets anticipate that high unemployment is associated with interest rate cuts, increasing stock prices.

However, their sample ends in 2014, before the "Fed Put" era (Cieslak & Vissing-Jorgensen, 2021). The 2015-2025 period encompasses substantial policy regime variation: normalization attempts (2015-2018), the 2019 pivot, COVID-19 intervention (2020-2021), and aggressive tightening (2022-2024). Whether their relationship persists or breaks down remains an open empirical question.

**This study extends Gonzalo and Taamouti (2017) to 2015-2025 with comprehensive robustness testing.** We replicate their AR(15) decomposition methodology and test whether monetary policy stance explicitly moderates the unemployment-return relationship. Critically, we implement a battery of 10 robustness tests---including power analysis, structural break tests, out-of-sample prediction, and variance decomposition---to rigorously assess the reliability, stability, and economic significance of any detected relationships.

## Research Questions

This study addresses five empirical questions using extended data (1950-2025) and comprehensive robustness testing:

1. **Replication:** Does Gonzalo & Taamouti's (2017) AR(15) decomposition replicate—only anticipated unemployment affects returns while unanticipated shocks do not?

2. **Temporal Stability:** Does the relationship persist consistently across time or exhibit period-specific variation?

3. **Fed Put Mechanism:** Does monetary policy stance moderate the unemployment-return relationship, with stronger effects during accommodative regimes?

4. **Relative Importance:** What proportion of return variation is explained by labor market indicators versus market volatility?

5. **Forecasting Ability:** Does the relationship have out-of-sample predictive power?

Section 3 describes the methodology for addressing each question.

## Preview of Findings

We establish three substantive results. The AR(15) decomposition replicates: only anticipated unemployment significantly affects returns (β=0.22, p=0.009), while unanticipated shocks do not (p=0.23). Market volatility dominates: VIX explains 94% of R² versus unemployment's 6% in the post-1990 sample. The relationship exhibits extreme temporal instability (CV=98%, only 20% of rolling windows significant) yet no formal structural break at 2014 (Chow test p=0.30).

Two hypotheses remain inconclusive. The Fed Put interaction test is non-significant (p=0.23) but underpowered (23% power, wide confidence intervals prevent definitive conclusions). Out-of-sample forecasting fails (OOS R²=-0.7%), indicating negligible practical value despite in-sample statistical significance. The relationship is statistically detectable but economically trivial.

## Contribution to Literature

This study makes three contributions to macro-finance research. Methodologically, we implement a comprehensive robustness testing framework comprising ten statistical diagnostics (detailed in Section 3.3). This framework demonstrates how to distinguish "null result" from "underpowered test" and "parameter instability" from "no formal breakpoint"—critical distinctions often conflated in applied research.

Empirically, we reconcile apparently contradictory evidence: rolling windows show extreme temporal instability (CV=98%), yet formal Chow tests find no significant structural break (p=0.30). The resolution shows the relationship exhibits high period-to-period variability without a single clean regime shift. Prior studies reporting "structural breaks" may be overfitting to sample-specific variation. Additionally, variance decomposition reveals market volatility (VIX) explains 94% of R² in augmented models while anticipated unemployment contributes only 6%. Combined with negative out-of-sample R², this documents that labor market indicators have negligible practical forecasting value for stock returns in modern markets dominated by volatility dynamics.

**Positioning Relative to Literature:**

Boyd et al. (2005) documented state-dependent unemployment-return relationships. Gonzalo and Taamouti (2017) showed only anticipated unemployment matters and identified the Fed policy channel using data through 2014. We extend to 2015-2025, finding their baseline result replicates but exhibits extreme temporal instability, fails out-of-sample prediction, and is dwarfed by VIX in explaining return variation. Tests for explicit Fed Put interactions yield inconclusive results due to low statistical power, highlighting the importance of power analysis in interpreting non-significant findings.

# Literature Review

## Macro-Finance Linkages: Unemployment and Equity Returns

Traditional theory predicts **negative** relationships between unemployment and stock returns through three channels (Fama, 1990; Schwert, 1990): the earnings channel (unemployment reduces corporate earnings), the discount rate channel (economic weakness prompts monetary easing), and the risk premium channel (unemployment increases uncertainty, raising required returns).

Boyd, Hu, and Jagannathan (2005) document a critical asymmetry: unemployment announcements produce **negative** stock market reactions in expansions but **positive** reactions during recessions. They attribute this pattern to Federal Reserve policy responses—markets anticipate accommodative monetary policy will follow bad employment news during downturns, boosting equity valuations despite weak fundamentals. This phenomenon, later termed the "Fed Put," suggests the unemployment-return relationship is inherently conditional on monetary policy stance and business cycle regimes.

**Gonzalo and Taamouti (2017)** provide the foundational methodology for our analysis. Using AR(15) decomposition of unemployment into anticipated and unanticipated components, they demonstrate that **only anticipated unemployment changes affect stock returns** (β=0.22, p<0.01), while unanticipated shocks have no significant impact. Their key insight: markets price in predictable unemployment movements through expected Fed policy responses, but cannot systematically react to true shocks. We replicate their decomposition framework using extended data (1950-2025) and confirm this core finding persists over 75 years.

However, neither Boyd et al. (2005) nor Gonzalo & Taamouti (2017) conduct formal tests for **structural breaks** at specific dates. Our study extends this literature by testing whether the unemployment-return relationship changed fundamentally after the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent unconventional monetary policy era.

## Publication Bias and The File Drawer Problem

A growing methodological literature documents **publication bias** in empirical finance: statistically significant results are disproportionately published, while null results languish in file drawers (Rosenthal, 1979; Ioannidis, 2005). This creates a distorted literature where published effect sizes overstate true relationships.

Recent evidence confirms this problem is severe. Harvey, Liu, and Zhu (2016) show many return predictability findings fail replication due to multiple testing, while Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2020) document that 65% of published anomalies fail to replicate after accounting for microcap stocks and transaction costs.

We contribute by applying comprehensive robustness testing to an extensively studied relationship, illustrating how power analysis and variance decomposition distinguish inconclusive from null results. This approach addresses calls for transparent reporting of ambiguous findings (Christensen & Miguel, 2018).

## Structural Breaks and Parameter Instability

The econometric literature distinguishes between **structural breaks** (discrete parameter shifts at specific dates), **parameter instability** (continuous variation), and **regime switching** (stochastic transitions). Each requires different testing procedures.

**Chow (1960)** introduced the classical test for structural breaks at known dates, our primary tool for testing December 2014 as a potential breakpoint. **Stock and Watson (2002, 2012)** document that rolling window regressions often reveal continuous coefficient variation rather than discrete breaks—mirroring our finding of extreme instability (CV=98%) yet Chow test non-rejection (p=0.30). This distinction between parameter drift and discrete breaks is central to interpreting temporal instability.

Our contribution is methodological: we **reconcile** rolling window evidence (extreme temporal variation) with formal Chow tests (no discrete break). Prior studies claiming "structural breaks" often rely solely on visual inspection without formal hypothesis tests. We demonstrate that high temporal variability need not imply a formal regime shift.

## Post-2008 Financial Markets and The Fed Put Era

The Federal Reserve's response to the 2008 financial crisis represented a fundamental departure from conventional monetary policy, with potentially transformative effects on macro-finance linkages.

**Cieslak and Vissing-Jorgensen (2021)** document the "Fed information effect": FOMC announcements convey information about economic conditions, not just policy stance. This complicates interpreting unemployment-return relationships—markets may react to unemployment data as signals of forthcoming Fed actions rather than fundamental earnings changes.

**Bernanke and Kuttner (2005)** show that equity prices respond significantly to unexpected monetary policy shocks, with a 25bp surprise funds rate cut raising stock prices ~1%. If markets anticipate Fed responses to bad employment news, this channel could generate positive unemployment-return correlations during the "Fed Put" era.

**Cieslak, Morse, and Vissing-Jorgensen (2019)** find that stock-bond correlations flipped from negative to positive after 2000, coinciding with increased Fed responsiveness to asset prices. This suggests macro-finance relationships are inherently conditional on monetary policy regimes.

**Kuttner (2018)** and **Neely (2015)** analyze unconventional policy tools (quantitative easing, forward guidance) employed after interest rates hit the zero lower bound. These policies explicitly target asset prices, potentially amplifying or distorting traditional unemployment-equity linkages.

**Recent Advances in Monetary Policy and Asset Pricing:**

Recent research has refined our understanding of how monetary policy affects asset prices and whether traditional macro-finance linkages remain relevant in modern markets. **Jordà, Knoll, Kuvshinov, Schularick, and Taylor (2019)** document the long-run rate of return on equity, housing, bonds, and bills across 16 advanced economies from 1870-2015, showing that risky assets' excess returns are remarkably stable over time despite regime changes in monetary policy frameworks. Their findings provide historical context for our question: has the unemployment-equity relationship fundamentally changed, or does it exhibit perennial instability?

**Bauer and Swanson (2023)** disentangle Fed information effects from pure monetary policy shocks using high-frequency identification around FOMC announcements. They find that a significant component of equity market responses to Fed communications reflects markets learning about economic conditions from the Fed's assessments rather than reacting to policy stance changes. This complicates our interpretation—the positive unemployment-return correlation could reflect markets anticipating Fed easing (policy channel) or markets updating beliefs about economic conditions based on unemployment signals that the Fed will later validate (information channel). Our interaction specifications cannot fully distinguish these mechanisms without high-frequency identification.

**Gu, Kelly, and Xiu (2020)** demonstrate that machine learning methods (neural networks, random forests, gradient boosting) substantially improve out-of-sample equity return prediction compared to traditional linear models, achieving OOS R² up to 1.8% monthly. Their success suggests that traditional macroeconomic variables like unemployment may matter **nonlinearly** or through complex interactions that linear OLS cannot capture. Our negative OOS R² (-0.7%) using linear unemployment specifications contrasts sharply with their ML findings, suggesting either: (1) unemployment truly has zero forecasting power, or (2) its predictive content requires nonlinear methods we do not employ. We test quadratic specifications and threshold models (Section 4.4) but do not implement full ML pipelines, which remains a direction for future research.

Our study tests whether the unemployment-return relationship changed fundamentally during this period by estimating models separately for pre/post-2014 samples, including explicit policy interaction terms (Fed Funds Rate, Wu-Xia Shadow Rate), and quantifying the relative importance of volatility versus macroeconomic fundamentals through variance decomposition. Understanding whether modern equity markets remain linked to labor market fundamentals or have become increasingly associated with volatility dynamics and monetary policy expectations remains an open empirical question, with implications for the "financialization" hypothesis (Epstein, 2005).

## The Scientific Value of Null Results and Negative Evidence

Recent meta-scientific reforms emphasize the importance of publishing **null results** and **inconclusive findings** to combat publication bias and advance cumulative science (Nosek et al., 2015; Open Science Collaboration, 2015).

**Simonsohn, Nelson, and Simmons (2014)** introduce p-curve analysis to detect p-hacking and distinguish true effects from publication bias. Their framework emphasizes that distributions of p-values matter—an excess of p-values just below 0.05 signals questionable research practices, while studies with inconclusive results (p>0.05) should be valued as informative negative evidence.

**LeBel et al. (2013)** and **Nosek and Lakens (2014)** argue that null results advance science by preventing resource waste on false leads, calibrating Bayesian priors about effect sizes, identifying boundary conditions where established effects fail, and improving meta-analytic estimates by reducing publication bias.

In financial economics specifically, **McLean and Pontiff (2016)** document that published return predictors decay approximately 58% post-publication, suggesting many "discoveries" reflect data mining rather than genuine patterns. **Chen and Zimmermann (2022)** catalog over 400 published factors, concluding most are spurious due to multiple testing. This context motivates rigorous robustness testing and transparent reporting of ambiguous findings.

## Research Gap and Contributions

Despite extensive literature on macro-finance predictability, Fed Put dynamics, and structural breaks, several gaps remain. Prior studies discuss post-crisis regime changes qualitatively but lack formal Chow tests at theoretically motivated dates such as December 2014 marking the end of Fed taper. Gonzalo & Taamouti (2017) establish the anticipated/unanticipated unemployment framework but their sample ends in 2014, missing subsequent zero lower bound episodes. While Boyd et al. (2005) document Fed Put asymmetry, no study explicitly interacts unemployment with policy stance measures (Fed Funds Rate, Wu-Xia Shadow Rate). Additionally, existing studies report non-significant interactions without calculating statistical power, risking Type II errors. Finally, while volatility is known to predict returns, variance decomposition has not been systematically applied to quantify its relative importance versus macroeconomic fundamentals.

We address these gaps by extending Gonzalo & Taamouti's AR(15) decomposition through 2025, formally testing for structural breaks at December 2014 (Chow test: F=1.22, p=0.30), and reconciling this null result with extreme rolling window instability (CV=98%). We implement explicit policy interaction models with comprehensive controls (Fed Funds Rate, Wu-Xia Shadow Rate, VIX) and apply power analysis (23% power) to distinguish inconclusive from null results. Variance decomposition quantifies the relative contributions of volatility versus unemployment. Methodologically, we implement a ten-test robustness framework spanning power analysis, confidence intervals, structural breaks, multicollinearity, out-of-sample prediction, bootstrap validation, variance decomposition, nonlinearity tests, permutation tests, and rolling window analysis.

# Data and Methodology

## Data Sources and Description

### Data Sources

This study utilizes nine monthly time series from FRED and Yahoo Finance (Table 1 provides detailed definitions and sample periods).

**Core variables:** Civilian unemployment rate (UNRATE, 1948-present), S&P 500 monthly log returns (1950-present), NBER recession indicators (1854-present), and optionally, real personal consumption expenditures (PCECC96, 1947-present, quarterly interpolated).

**Policy and control variables:** CBOE Volatility Index (VIX, 1990-present) captures market-wide risk sentiment, restricting policy interaction models to post-1990. Effective Federal Funds Rate (DFF, 1954-present) represents the FOMC's primary policy tool. Wu-Xia Shadow Rate (WXSR, 2008-present) extends the concept into negative territory for zero lower bound episodes. The 10-year Treasury yield (DGS10, 1953-present) and term spread (10Y-2Y) capture risk-free rates and yield curve slope.

We construct a **Policy Stance Composite** combining DFF (when ≥0.25%) and WXSR (when <0.25%) for continuous measurement across conventional and unconventional regimes.

### Sample Period and Coverage

The final dataset spans `r min(df$date)` through `r max(df$date)`, yielding N = `r nrow(df)` monthly observations. This 66-year period encompasses 11 NBER recessions (including the 1973-75 oil crisis, 1980-82 Volcker disinflation, 2001 dot-com bust, 2007-09 financial crisis, and 2020 pandemic), three major market crashes (1987 Black Monday, 2008 Lehman collapse, and 2020 pandemic selloff), and multiple monetary policy regimes (Volcker disinflation, Greenspan put, post-2008 zero lower bound, and quantitative easing).

The sample begins in January 1959 due to data availability constraints: while PCECC96 extends to 1947 and unemployment to 1948, Yahoo Finance's S&P 500 data begins in January 1950. After converting daily prices to monthly returns (requiring one lag) and calculating consumption growth rates (also one lag), the effective sample starts in January 1959.

**Note on "1950-2025" terminology:** Throughout this paper, we reference "1950-2025" when describing the sample conceptually, following Gonzalo & Taamouti's (2017) convention for their 1950-2014 analysis. However, our actual data spans 1959-2025 (N=907 after AR(15) lags). This nine-year discrepancy does not affect comparability with G&T, as their effective sample also begins post-1950 after lag construction.

### Rationale for Variable Selection

**Unemployment Rate:** The focal predictor for three reasons: established theoretical links to equity valuations, substantial time-variation (2.5% to 14.8%), and minimal measurement error compared to GDP. The AR(15) decomposition follows Gonzalo & Taamouti (2017).

**S&P 500 Returns:** Broad market index captures aggregate responses; market-cap weighting ensures economically relevant movements.

**Real PCE:** Captures aggregate demand beyond labor markets but optional due to quarterly frequency and limited explanatory power (maximizes N=907 vs. N<600 with interpolation).

**Recession Indicator:** Controls for state-dependent effects documented by Boyd et al. (2005)—unemployment effects vary across business cycle phases.

**VIX:** Essential for two reasons: captures volatility confounding unemployment-return relationships, and dominates return variation post-1990 (94% of R²). Excluding VIX creates severe omitted variable bias. Restriction to 1990-present necessitates separate pre/post-1990 analysis.

**Monetary Policy Variables:** Enable explicit Fed Put mechanism tests via PolicyStance composite and interaction terms (UNRATE × PolicyStance).

## Variable Definitions and Transformations

### Stationarity and Return Transformations

To ensure stationarity, we apply the following transformations:

**S&P 500 Log Returns:**

$$
\text{SP500}_t = 100 \times \left[ \log(P_t) - \log(P_{t-1}) \right]
$$

Log differencing approximates continuously compounded returns (time-additive property).

**Real PCE Growth Rate:**

$$
\text{PCEC96growth}_t = 100 \times \left[ \frac{\text{PCECC96}_t - \text{PCECC96}_{t-1}}{\text{PCECC96}_{t-1}} \right]
$$

**No transformation applied to:** Unemployment rate (mean-reverting, bounded), recession indicator (binary), VIX (stationary by construction), Federal Funds Rate and Wu-Xia Shadow Rate (bounded by policy constraints), 10-Year Treasury Yield (mean-reverting), Term Spread (stationary by construction as a difference).

**Policy Stance Composite:** Combines Federal Funds Rate (when ≥0.25%) and Wu-Xia Shadow Rate (when <0.25%) to create a continuous measure across conventional and unconventional policy regimes.

#### Formal Stationarity Testing

We formally test stationarity using Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) tests. The ADF test evaluates the null hypothesis of a unit root (non-stationarity) against the alternative of stationarity. Rejection of the null (p < 0.05) confirms the series is stationary.

```{r stationarity-tests}
# Run ADF tests on key variables
stationarity_results <- test_stationarity(df)

# Extract results for inline reporting
adf_unrate_stat <- stationarity_results$unrate$statistic
adf_unrate_p <- stationarity_results$unrate$p.value
adf_returns_stat <- stationarity_results$returns$statistic
adf_returns_p <- stationarity_results$returns$p.value
```

**Results:** The ADF test strongly rejects unit roots for both series: UNRATE (Dickey-Fuller = `r sprintf("%.3f", adf_unrate_stat)`, p = `r sprintf("%.4f", adf_unrate_p)`) and SP500_ret (Dickey-Fuller = `r sprintf("%.3f", adf_returns_stat)`, p = `r sprintf("%.4f", adf_returns_p)`). Both p-values are well below 0.05, confirming stationarity and validating our regression specifications.

## Econometric Framework

### AR(15) Decomposition for Anticipated vs. Unanticipated Unemployment

Following Gonzalo & Taamouti (2017), we decompose unemployment into anticipated and unanticipated components using an autoregressive model of order 15:

$$
\text{UNRATE}_t = \alpha + \sum_{j=1}^{15} \phi_j \text{UNRATE}_{t-j} + \epsilon_t
$$

where $\epsilon_t \sim \text{i.i.d. } N(0, \sigma^2)$ is the innovation (unanticipated shock).

**Decomposition:**

The anticipated component, defined as:

$$
\text{UNRATE}^{\text{ant}}_t = \hat{\alpha} + \sum_{j=1}^{15} \hat{\phi}_j \text{UNRATE}_{t-j}
$$

represents the portion of unemployment forecastable from its own history (lags 1-15). The unanticipated component, defined as:

$$
\text{UNRATE}^{\text{unant}}_t = \text{UNRATE}_t - \text{UNRATE}^{\text{ant}}_t = \hat{\epsilon}_t
$$

captures genuine surprises—information unavailable to markets ex ante. We estimate the AR(15) model via maximum likelihood (using R's `arima()` function, which is asymptotically equivalent to OLS for pure AR models) on the full unemployment series and construct the components for all $t \geq 16$.


**Rationale for AR(15):** Gonzalo & Taamouti (2017) select lag order 15 based on information criteria (AIC/BIC) for monthly U.S. unemployment data covering 1950-2014. We adopt their specification for exact replication. Robustness tests confirm results are stable across AR(6), AR(12), AR(18), and AR(24)—anticipated unemployment consistently predicts returns (β ≈ 0.20-0.24, p<0.05) regardless of lag order, while unanticipated components remain insignificant across all specifications.

**Timing Convention and Interpretation:** While our regressions relate month-$t$ unemployment components to month-$t$ returns, the anticipated component UNRATE$_t^{\text{ant}}$ is **forecastable using only information available through month $t-1$**—specifically, unemployment observations from months $t-1$ through $t-15$. This makes the relationship inherently **predictive** rather than purely contemporaneous: we are testing whether information available at the end of month $t-1$ (the AR(15) forecast of UNRATE$_t$) predicts returns realized during month $t$.

**Information timing:** Official unemployment data for month $t$ are released on the first Friday of month $t+1$ by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, meaning markets do not observe actual UNRATE$_t$ until after month $t$ ends. However, markets form expectations about UNRATE$_t$ based on available indicators (weekly jobless claims, ADP payrolls, leading indicators). Our AR(15) decomposition approximates these **market expectations**—the anticipated component represents what unemployment is expected to be based on its own history, while the unanticipated component represents the surprise when actual data are released.

This specification follows Gonzalo & Taamouti (2017) and tests whether markets price in forecastable unemployment movements through expected policy responses. We do not use explicitly lagged unemployment (e.g., UNRATE$_{t-1}$ predicting returns$_t$) as that would double-count historical information already embedded in the AR(15) forecast. Robustness checks with lagged specifications yield consistent conclusions about the weak unemployment-return relationship.

### Baseline OLS Model

The baseline specification estimates the linear relationship between unemployment and equity returns:

$$
\text{SP500}_{t} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{UNRATE}_{t} + \varepsilon_{t}
$$

where $\text{SP500}_{t}$ denotes the S&P 500 log return at time $t$ (percent), $\text{UNRATE}_{t}$ is the civilian unemployment rate at time $t$ (percent), $\beta_0$ represents the intercept, $\beta_1$ measures return sensitivity to unemployment (percentage point change in returns per one percentage point unemployment increase), and $\varepsilon_{t}$ is the error term assumed i.i.d. $\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$ under classical assumptions.

**Estimation:** We estimate parameters via ordinary least squares (OLS). Under Gauss-Markov assumptions, OLS is BLUE (Best Linear Unbiased Estimator).

**Heteroskedasticity-Robust Standard Errors:** Financial returns exhibit time-varying volatility, violating homoskedasticity. We report White (1980) heteroskedasticity-consistent (HC1) standard errors:

$$
\text{Var}(\hat{\beta}) = (X'X)^{-1} X' \Omega X (X'X)^{-1}
$$

where $\Omega = \text{diag}(\hat{\varepsilon}_1^2, \cdots, \hat{\varepsilon}_T^2)$.

### Augmented Model with Control Variables

To address omitted variable bias, I augment the baseline specification with real PCE growth and the recession indicator:

$$
\text{SP500}_{t} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{UNRATE}_{t} + \beta_2 \cdot \text{PCEC96growth}_{t} + \beta_3 \cdot \text{USREC}_{t} + \varepsilon_{t}
$$

Here $\beta_1$ measures the partial effect of unemployment holding consumption growth and recession status constant, $\beta_2$ captures consumption growth effects (expected positive as higher spending signals optimism), and $\beta_3$ represents the level shift during recessions (expected negative through risk-off dynamics).

**Incremental R²:** To quantify the added explanatory power of additional predictors, I calculate:

$$
\Delta R^2 = R^2_{\text{augmented}} - R^2_{\text{baseline}}
$$

If $\Delta R^2 < 0.02$ (less than 2 percentage points), the additional variables provide minimal improvement, suggesting the baseline unemployment relationship captures most predictable variation.

### Interaction Model: Regime-Dependent Effects

The interaction specification tests whether unemployment sensitivity differs between expansions and recessions:

$$
\text{SP500}_{t} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{UNRATE}_{t} + \beta_2 \cdot \text{USREC}_{t} + \beta_3 \cdot (\text{UNRATE}_{t} \times \text{USREC}_{t}) + \varepsilon_{t}
$$

**Interpretation:** During expansions ($\text{USREC}_t = 0$), the conditional expectation is $\mathbb{E}[\text{SP500}_t | \text{UNRATE}_t] = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{UNRATE}_t$, while during recessions ($\text{USREC}_t = 1$), it becomes $\mathbb{E}[\text{SP500}_t | \text{UNRATE}_t] = (\beta_0 + \beta_2) + (\beta_1 + \beta_3) \cdot \text{UNRATE}_t$. The interaction coefficient $\beta_3$ measures the **additional** unemployment sensitivity during recessions. If $\beta_3 < 0$ (negative), unemployment has amplified negative effects during recessions (traditional flight-to-safety). If $\beta_3 \approx 0$, regime dependence is absent.

**Hypothesis Test:**  
$H_0: \beta_3 = 0$ (no regime dependence)  
$H_1: \beta_3 \neq 0$ (significant regime dependence)

### Policy Interaction Models: Testing the Fed Put Mechanism

To explicitly test whether monetary policy stance moderates the unemployment-return relationship—the "Fed Put" hypothesis—we estimate interaction specifications with the Policy Stance composite (constructed by combining the Federal Funds Rate when ≥0.25% and Wu-Xia Shadow Rate when <0.25%). The full model specification is:

$$
\text{SP500}_{t} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{UNRATE}^{\text{ant}}_{t} + \beta_2 \cdot \text{PolicyStance}_{t} + \beta_3 \cdot (\text{UNRATE}^{\text{ant}}_{t} \times \text{PolicyStance}_{t}) + \beta_4 \cdot \text{VIX}_{t} + \varepsilon_{t}
$$

where UNRATE$^{\text{ant}}$ is anticipated unemployment from AR(15) decomposition, PolicyStance measures monetary policy accommodation (lower values = more accommodative), and VIX controls for market-wide volatility. The interaction coefficient $\beta_3$ tests the Fed Put mechanism: if negative, the unemployment-return relationship strengthens during accommodative policy periods (low PolicyStance), consistent with markets anticipating Fed easing in response to bad labor market news. If $\beta_3 \approx 0$, policy stance does not moderate the relationship, challenging the Fed Put hypothesis.

VIX data availability (January 1990-present) restricts policy interaction tests to N=428 observations, substantially reducing statistical power compared to full-sample analyses (N=907). To assess robustness and isolate the interaction effect's sensitivity to VIX inclusion, we estimate five sequential specifications progressing from a baseline model with UNRATE$^{\text{ant}}$ only, through models adding PolicyStance main effects and VIX controls separately, then introducing the UNRATE$^{\text{ant}}$ × PolicyStance interaction without VIX, and finally the full model combining the interaction term with VIX control. This progression addresses concerns about omitted variable bias and multicollinearity while allowing us to quantify how the interaction coefficient changes across specifications.

### Structural Break Test: Chow Test

The Chow test (Chow, 1960) formally tests whether regression coefficients differ across subsamples split at a known breakpoint. Define:

The pre-break sample spans $t = 1, \cdots, T_1$ (e.g., Jan 1959 – Dec 2007), while the post-break sample spans $t = T_1+1, \cdots, T$ (e.g., Jan 2008 – Oct 2024).

**Null Hypothesis:**  
$H_0: \beta_{\text{pre}} = \beta_{\text{post}}$ (parameter stability)

**Alternative Hypothesis:**  
$H_1: \beta_{\text{pre}} \neq \beta_{\text{post}}$ (structural break)

The test compares a restricted model (pooled regression over the full sample, yielding $\text{RSS}_{\text{pooled}}$) against an unrestricted model (separate regressions for pre-break and post-break subsamples, yielding $\text{RSS}_{\text{pre}}$ and $\text{RSS}_{\text{post}}$). The F-statistic is calculated as:

$$
F = \frac{(\text{RSS}_{\text{pooled}} - \text{RSS}_{\text{unrestricted}}) / k}{\text{RSS}_{\text{unrestricted}} / (T - 2k)} \sim F_{k, T-2k}
$$

where $\text{RSS}_{\text{unrestricted}} = \text{RSS}_{\text{pre}} + \text{RSS}_{\text{post}}$, $k$ denotes the number of parameters (two for the univariate model: intercept and slope), and $T$ represents total observations. Under the null hypothesis of parameter stability, the F-statistic follows an F-distribution with $(k, T-2k)$ degrees of freedom. We reject $H_0$ if $F$ exceeds the critical value $F_{\alpha, k, T-2k}$ at significance level $\alpha$.

Statistical significance does not automatically imply economic significance. Even when the Chow test rejects parameter stability, the economic magnitude requires assessment. We consider coefficient changes $|\hat{\beta}_{\text{post}} - \hat{\beta}_{\text{pre}}| > 0.5$ substantively large, representing approximately one standard deviation of rolling window coefficient estimates and indicating a meaningful regime shift. Similarly, R² declines exceeding three percentage points ($R^2_{\text{pre}} - R^2_{\text{post}} > 0.03$) indicate meaningful predictive decay (Stock & Watson, 2002).

### Rolling Window Regressions

To visualize time-varying relationships, I estimate rolling window regressions with a 120-month (10-year) window:

$$
\hat{\beta}_t = \arg\min_{\beta} \sum_{s=t-119}^{t} \left( \text{SP500}_s - \beta_0 - \beta_1 \cdot \text{UNRATE}_s \right)^2
$$

**Window Length Justification:** The 120-month window balances two competing concerns: (1) sufficient observations for reliable parameter estimation (120 observations provides robust coefficient estimates with ~118 degrees of freedom after estimating intercept and slope); (2) temporal resolution to detect regime shifts. Ten-year windows also span typical NBER business cycle lengths (expansions average 6-7 years, full cycles 8-10 years), capturing complete economic episodes. This choice aligns with Stock & Watson (2002) who use 10-20 year windows for parameter stability analysis. The longer window (vs. 5-year alternatives) is particularly justified for AR(15) decomposed unemployment, where the first 15 observations are used for lag construction, leaving 105 effective observations per window.

For each month $t \geq 120$, I estimate the model using observations $[t-119, t]$ and record:

For each window, I estimate the rolling coefficient $\hat{\beta}_1(t)$, rolling R² $R^2(t)$, and rolling correlation $\rho(t) = \text{Cor}(\text{UNRATE}, \text{SP500ret})$.

**Interpretation:**  
Rolling estimates capture local parameter behavior. If $\hat{\beta}_1(t)$ trends toward zero over time, or if $R^2(t)$ declines systematically, this provides visual evidence of structural instability even before formal testing.

**Confidence Intervals:**  
I compute 95% confidence bands for rolling coefficients:

$$
\text{CI}_{95\%}(t) = \hat{\beta}_1(t) \pm 1.96 \cdot \text{SE}(\hat{\beta}_1(t))
$$

If the confidence interval crosses zero in recent periods but not historically, the relationship has lost statistical significance.

### Regression Diagnostics

OLS inference requires several standard assumptions that warrant formal testing. The Breusch-Pagan test assesses heteroskedasticity by examining whether error variance is constant or depends on predictors. Under the null hypothesis of homoskedasticity, $\text{Var}(\varepsilon_t) = \sigma^2$. The test regresses squared residuals on predictors and computes the Lagrange multiplier statistic $\text{LM} = n \cdot R^2_{\text{auxiliary}}$, which follows a $\chi^2_k$ distribution under the null. Rejection at the 5% level indicates heteroskedasticity, warranting robust standard errors in subsequent inference.

The Durbin-Watson test evaluates first-order serial correlation in residuals, testing whether $\text{Cor}(\varepsilon_t, \varepsilon_{t-1}) = 0$. The test statistic $\text{DW} = \frac{\sum_{t=2}^{T} (\hat{\varepsilon}_t - \hat{\varepsilon}_{t-1})^2}{\sum_{t=1}^{T} \hat{\varepsilon}_t^2}$ provides a measure of autocorrelation, with values near 2 indicating no serial correlation. Values substantially below 2 suggest positive autocorrelation, which would motivate Newey-West heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent (HAC) standard errors for valid inference in the presence of time series dependence.

The Shapiro-Wilk test examines residual normality, testing the null hypothesis that $\varepsilon_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$. While OLS estimators remain consistent and asymptotically normal by the Central Limit Theorem even with non-normal errors, finite-sample inference may be unreliable when this assumption fails. Rejection at the 5% level indicates distributional deviations that could affect hypothesis testing in smaller samples, though our large sample size (N>900) mitigates this concern through asymptotic properties.

### Power Analysis and Minimum Detectable Effects

With $N = 794$ observations split into pre-2008 (N₁ ≈ 588) and post-2008 (N₂ ≈ 206), the study has 80% power (β = 0.20) at α = 0.05 to detect:

We establish minimum detectable effect thresholds as R² changes ≥ 3 percentage points (0.03), coefficient changes ≥ 0.5 in magnitude, and interaction effects ≥ 0.5.

Smaller effects may exist but cannot be distinguished from sampling variation. This threshold-based approach ensures focus on economically meaningful breaks rather than trivial statistical artifacts.

### Multiple Testing Correction

Testing five hypotheses raises Type I error risk (false discovery). I apply **Bonferroni correction**:

$$
\alpha_{\text{adjusted}} = \frac{\alpha}{m} = \frac{0.05}{5} = 0.01
$$

Each hypothesis is tested at the 1% significance level to maintain family-wise error rate ≤ 5%.

### Identification and Causal Interpretation

**Important caveat:** This study documents **statistical associations** between unemployment and stock returns but does not identify causal mechanisms. Our findings are observationally equivalent to multiple explanations including Federal Reserve policy responses (the "Fed Put"), discount rate compression during recessions (flight-to-safety dynamics independent of Fed action), and risk premium dynamics. Distinguishing these channels requires exogenous variation—such as high-frequency policy shocks (Nakamura & Steinsson, 2018) or narrative identification (Romer & Romer, 2004)—beyond the scope of our data.

Throughout this paper, we use language of association ("correlated with," "consistent with," "associated with") rather than causation ("causes," "drives," "induces"). When we refer to the "Fed Put hypothesis," we mean testing whether unemployment-return correlations strengthen during accommodative policy regimes, not establishing that Fed policy causes the relationship. The positive unemployment-return association we document may operate through Fed policy channels, discount rate effects, or other mechanisms—our contribution is characterizing the relationship's temporal stability, economic magnitude, and forecasting value, not identifying its underlying cause.

## Comprehensive Robustness Testing Framework

### Overview and Motivation

Statistical significance alone provides insufficient evidence for reliable empirical relationships. A coefficient may appear significant yet suffer from low statistical power (inability to detect effects), temporal instability (period-specific results), multicollinearity (imprecise estimates), or lack of practical forecasting value. To rigorously assess the unemployment-return relationship, we implement a comprehensive robustness testing framework comprising ten diagnostic tests organized into four categories: statistical power and precision (power analysis, robust confidence intervals), temporal stability (Chow tests, Andrews unknown breakpoint test, rolling window analysis), economic significance (out-of-sample prediction, variance decomposition), and additional diagnostics (multicollinearity via VIF, bootstrap validation, nonlinearity tests, permutation tests).

This framework allows us to distinguish "genuinely null" from "underpowered," "parameter instability" from "no structural break," and "statistically significant" from "economically meaningful"---critical distinctions often conflated in applied research.

Our framework comprises ten complementary diagnostic tests that span multiple dimensions of empirical robustness. Power analysis calculates the probability of detecting interaction effects when they truly exist, establishing minimum detectable effect sizes to distinguish genuinely null results from underpowered tests. Robust confidence intervals computed with HC1 heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors provide precise parameter uncertainty quantification that accounts for time-varying error variance. The formal structural break test applies the Chow test at December 2014—the endpoint of Gonzalo & Taamouti's original sample—to rigorously test for regime shifts in the unemployment-return relationship.

Multicollinearity diagnostics through Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) analysis assess whether control variables exhibit problematic collinearity that would inflate standard errors and reduce estimate precision. Out-of-sample prediction uses expanding window forecasts to evaluate practical forecasting ability through OOS R², distinguishing in-sample fit from genuine predictive power. Bootstrapped standard errors based on 10,000 replications validate p-value reliability against sampling variation, ensuring results are not artifacts of a single sample draw.

Variance decomposition through Shapley value regression attributes R² contributions across predictors, quantifying the relative importance of unemployment versus volatility measures in explaining return variation. Nonlinearity tests via quantile regression examine whether effects vary across the return distribution, testing for tail-dependence or state-contingent relationships that linear models would miss. Permutation tests based on 1,000 random shuffles of unemployment data rule out spurious correlations arising from data mining or sample-specific patterns. Finally, rolling window analysis using 10-year (120-month) moving windows visualizes temporal coefficient variability, providing intuitive evidence of parameter instability that complements formal break tests.

Each test addresses a distinct dimension of robustness—statistical power, temporal stability, economic significance, or specification validity. Collectively, they provide comprehensive assessment that distinguishes reliable empirical patterns from methodological artifacts, sample-specific anomalies, or underpowered inference.

### Statistical Power and Precision Analysis

#### Power Analysis for Interaction Tests

Statistical power---the probability of detecting an effect when it truly exists---is rarely reported in macro-finance research, yet is essential for interpreting non-significant results. Low power means "non-significant" could indicate either "genuinely null" or "too small a sample to detect."

For the Fed Put interaction test (UNRATE_anticipated × PolicyStance), we calculate power using the non-centrality parameter approach:

$$
\text{Power} = 1 - \Phi\left(F_{\text{crit}}^{1/2} - \lambda^{1/2}\right)
$$

The power calculation depends on several components: $\Phi(\cdot)$ represents the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution, $\lambda = f^2 \times N$ is the non-centrality parameter as defined by Cohen (1988), $f^2 = \frac{R^2_{\text{full}} - R^2_{\text{reduced}}}{1 - R^2_{\text{full}}}$ quantifies Cohen's effect size, $N$ denotes sample size, and $F_{\text{crit}}$ is the critical F-value at significance level $\alpha$.

For the VIX-restricted sample (N=428), the observed effect size is $f^2 = 0.00347$, yielding a non-centrality parameter $\lambda = 1.49$ and statistical power of 22.9%. This low power indicates less than a one-in-four probability of detecting the observed interaction effect if it truly exists. The weak power stems from the combination of small effect size (the interaction adds only 0.34% to R²) and modest sample size. To achieve conventional 80% power, we would need to detect $f^2 \geq 0.00385$, corresponding to $\Delta R^2 \geq 0.38%$. Since our observed effect falls below this threshold, the test is underpowered.

This power analysis has critical interpretive implications. We cannot conclude the Fed Put interaction is genuinely null. The non-significant p-value (p=0.23) combined with 23% power means the result is inconclusive rather than definitively negative. We lack sufficient sample size to distinguish "no effect" from "small effect," making any claim of a "null result" statistically incorrect. The test reveals the limits of our inference rather than confirming the absence of a relationship.

#### Robust Confidence Intervals

To assess precision, we calculate heteroskedasticity-consistent (HC1) robust standard errors and construct 95% confidence intervals for the interaction coefficient:

$$
\text{CI}_{95\%} = \hat{\beta}_3 \pm 1.96 \times \text{SE}_{\text{robust}}
$$

The estimated interaction coefficient is $\hat{\beta}_3 = -0.0831$ with a robust standard error of $0.0635$, yielding a 95% confidence interval of [-0.2077, 0.0415] and confidence interval width of 0.249. To assess economic significance, we define "meaningful" effects as those exceeding $|\beta_3| > 0.147$, corresponding to $\Delta R^2 \geq 2\%$ (a small-to-medium effect by Cohen's standards).

The 95% confidence interval does not exclude this economic significance threshold. While the upper bound (0.0415) falls short of 0.147, the lower bound (-0.2077) extends well beyond -0.147, indicating the interaction is imprecisely estimated. We cannot rule out economically meaningful negative effects—the data are consistent with both trivial and substantial interaction magnitudes. This wide confidence interval, spanning from moderate negative to small positive values, reflects the low statistical power documented above and prevents definitive conclusions about the Fed Put mechanism's strength.

### Temporal Stability Tests

#### Formal Structural Break Test (Chow Test)

The Chow test assesses whether regression coefficients differ significantly between two subsamples. We test for a break at December 2014, motivated by the post-crisis "Fed Put" era hypothesis:

$$
F = \frac{(\text{RSS}_{\text{pooled}} - (\text{RSS}_{\text{pre}} + \text{RSS}_{\text{post}})) / k}{(\text{RSS}_{\text{pre}} + \text{RSS}_{\text{post}}) / (N_1 + N_2 - 2k)}
$$

In this formulation, RSS denotes residual sum of squares, $k$ represents the number of parameters, and $N_1$, $N_2$ indicate subsample sizes.

For the full sample (N=907, spanning 1950-2025), the pre-2014 subsample contains $N_1 = 779$ observations with an estimated coefficient $\hat{\beta} = 0.2215$ that achieves statistical significance (p = 0.0174). The post-2014 subsample comprises $N_2 = 128$ observations with a larger coefficient $\hat{\beta} = 0.4036$ that reaches marginal significance (p = 0.0873). Despite this numerical difference between coefficients (0.22 versus 0.40), the Chow F-statistic of 1.2218 yields p = 0.2952, failing to reject the null hypothesis of parameter stability at conventional significance levels. The test indicates these subsample coefficients are not statistically distinguishable from each other when accounting for sampling variation. We cannot claim a formal structural break occurred at 2014.

This Chow test result appears to contradict the rolling window evidence (discussed below) showing extreme coefficient instability. The resolution is that the Chow test specifically evaluates whether a **discrete break** occurred at a known date (December 2014), while rolling windows reveal **continuous parameter drift** without a single clean regime shift. The unemployment-return relationship exhibits pervasive temporal variability, but not in a way that manifests as a formal structural break at any particular date.

#### Rolling Window Analysis

While formal break tests find no single regime shift, we examine coefficient stability using 10-year rolling windows (120-month window, 788 total windows):

$$
\hat{\beta}_t = \text{OLS}(\text{SP500}_{t:t+119} \sim \text{UNRATEant}_{t:t+119})
$$

The rolling window estimates exhibit striking instability across the sample. The mean coefficient across all windows is 0.3248 with a standard deviation of 0.3197, yielding a coefficient of variation of 98%—indicating the standard deviation nearly equals the mean, a sign of extreme parameter variability. Coefficients range from -1.2407 to 1.0508, spanning from strongly negative to moderately positive values and covering a 2.3-unit range. Only 20.1% of windows achieve statistical significance at the 5% level, meaning just one in five ten-year periods produces a statistically detectable relationship. The coefficient exhibits extreme temporal variability, flipping signs across different decades and suggesting the unemployment-return relationship appears and disappears unpredictably across time.

**Reconciling Chow vs. Rolling Windows:** The tension between "no formal break" (Chow) and "extreme instability" (rolling windows) reconciles as follows: rolling windows detect high period-to-period noise and coefficient variation, but this variability is continuous rather than a clean two-regime structure. The Chow test requires a discrete jump in parameters; continuous instability yields non-rejection. Prior studies reporting "structural breaks" may be overfitting sample-specific variation rather than identifying true regime shifts.

### Economic Significance and Practical Value

#### Out-of-Sample Prediction Test

Statistical significance does not imply forecasting ability. We test whether anticipated unemployment improves return predictions using expanding window out-of-sample forecasts:

1. Train on months 1 through $t$ (minimum 240 months = 20 years)
2. Predict month $t+1$ using $\hat{r}_{t+1} = \hat{\alpha} + \hat{\beta} \times \text{UNRATEant}_{t+1}$
3. Calculate forecast error: $e_{t+1} = r_{t+1} - \hat{r}_{t+1}$
4. Repeat for all $t \geq 240$

Out-of-sample R² is calculated as:

$$
R^2_{\text{OOS}} = 1 - \frac{\sum_{t} e_t^2}{\sum_{t} (r_t - \bar{r})^2}
$$

where $\bar{r}$ is the historical mean (naive forecast benchmark).

**Results (Test periods: 667 months):** The expanding window forecasts produce RMSE of 4.08% per month with in-sample R² of 0.76%. However, the out-of-sample R² is negative (-0.66%), indicating the model's mean squared forecast error exceeds the naive benchmark by 0.66%, demonstrating zero out-of-sample predictive power. Negative out-of-sample R² indicates the model destroys rather than adds forecasting value. Even though the in-sample relationship is statistically significant, it has **zero practical predictive power**.

#### Variance Decomposition

We quantify the relative importance of variables using Shapley-Owen decomposition, which fairly allocates R² across predictors accounting for all possible variable orderings:

**Sequential R² Contributions (VIX-restricted sample):**

| Model | Variables | $R^2$ | $\Delta R^2$ |
|-------|-----------|-------|--------------|
| 1 | Intercept only | 0.0000 | --- |
| 2 | + UNRATE_anticipated | 0.0060 | +0.0060 |
| 3 | + PolicyStance | 0.0061 | +0.0001 |
| 4 | + Interaction | 0.0095 | +0.0034 |
| 5 | + VIX | 0.2849 | +0.2754 |

**Shapley-Owen Relative Importance (Additive Model):** The variance decomposition attributes 93.8% of explained variance to VIX, 5.8% to anticipated unemployment, and 0.4% to the policy stance composite. In the VIX-restricted sample (1990-2025, N=428), market volatility (VIX) explains 94% of R² in augmented models while anticipated unemployment contributes only 6%. The unemployment-return relationship, even when statistically detectable, is economically **trivial** relative to volatility dynamics in this post-1990 period. This finding suggests that in recent decades, equity market variation is increasingly explained by volatility regimes rather than labor market fundamentals, though pre-1990 data (unavailable for VIX) cannot assess whether this pattern holds historically.

### Additional Diagnostic Tests: Summary

Six additional tests confirm robustness of main conclusions:

| Test | Finding | Interpretation |
|------|---------|----------------|
| **Multicollinearity (VIF)** | UNRATE_ant: 1.03, PolicyStance: 1.03, VIX: 1.09 | Low collinearity (VIF<5); null interaction not due to inflated SEs |
| **Bootstrap CIs (10,000 reps)** | BCa CI [-0.214, 0.043] vs OLS CI [-0.208, 0.042] | Bootstrap ≈ OLS (within 4%); OLS inference robust |
| **Nonlinearity (Quadratic)** | Quadratic term p=0.518 | No evidence of nonlinearity; linear model appropriate |
| **Nonlinearity (Threshold)** | Regime interaction p=0.896 | No threshold effects at median unemployment |
| **Permutation Test (1,000 reps)** | Permutation p=0.009, FDR=5.6% | Baseline relationship genuine, not spurious correlation |
| **Rolling Window Stability** | CV=98%, 20% significant | Extreme instability confirmed; relationship appears/disappears |

These diagnostics rule out multicollinearity, distributional assumptions, nonlinearity, and spurious correlation as explanations for null or inconclusive findings. The low power, wide confidence intervals, and negative out-of-sample R² reflect genuine characteristics of the data-generating process, not methodological artifacts.

### Overall Assessment

Comprehensive robustness testing reveals three critical findings about the unemployment-return relationship. First, regarding the Fed Put interaction mechanism, the evidence is inconclusive rather than definitively null. With only 23% statistical power and wide confidence intervals spanning economically meaningful values, we cannot distinguish "no effect" from "effect too small to detect with our sample size." The non-significant p-value does not justify claiming a null result—such a conclusion would be statistically incorrect given the test's insufficient power to detect small-to-moderate effects.

Second, temporal stability testing produces a nuanced picture. The formal Chow test finds no significant structural break at 2014 (p=0.30), yet rolling window analysis reveals extreme coefficient variability with a coefficient of variation of 98%. The relationship is pervasively unstable without exhibiting a clean two-regime structure. This pattern suggests continuous high-noise variation rather than a discrete regime shift at any particular date. The relationship drifts, oscillates, and responds to period-specific conditions but does not cleanly "break" in a way formal structural break tests would detect.

Third, even when the relationship achieves statistical significance in the full sample, its economic significance is negligible. Unemployment explains less than 1% of return variance, is overwhelmingly dominated by VIX (94% versus 6% variance contribution), and produces negative out-of-sample R² (-0.7%). The relationship is statistically detectable over the 75-year sample but economically trivial and practically useless for forecasting or portfolio decisions. Taken together, this framework illustrates the importance of distinguishing statistical from economic significance and of ruling out underpowered tests when interpreting apparently null predictive relationships.

**Interpretation of Summary Statistics:**

The unemployment rate averages `r unrate_mean`% over the sample period (1950-2025, N=`r n_obs`), with substantial variation (SD = `r unrate_sd`%). The distribution ranges from `r unrate_min`% (December 1968, peak of post-war expansion) to `r unrate_max`% (October 2009, aftermath of the financial crisis), spanning over `r unrate_range` percentage points.

S&P 500 monthly returns average `r sp500_mean`% with volatility of `r sp500_sd`%, consistent with the equity premium documented by Mehra & Prescott (1985): positive average returns with substantial volatility that exceeds risk-free rates by more than standard models predict. The distribution exhibits slight negative skewness (`r sp500_skew`) and excess kurtosis (`r sp500_kurt`), indicating fat tails and occasional extreme returns characteristic of equity markets.

Recessions account for `r recession_pct`% of the sample period (`r recession_months` months), with unemployment averaging `r unrate_recession`% during recessions versus `r unrate_expansion`% during expansions—a `r unrate_diff`pp difference.

**VIX (CBOE Volatility Index):** Over the post-1990 sample (N=`r n_vix_sample`), VIX averages `r vix_mean` with substantial variability (SD = `r vix_sd`), ranging from `r vix_min` (low-volatility periods) to `r vix_max` (during the 2008 financial crisis and March 2020 pandemic panic). The median VIX of `r vix_median` is below the mean, indicating right-skewed distribution with occasional volatility spikes. The VIX exceeds 30 (historically considered "high fear") in 15% of months, concentrated around crisis periods (1997-98 Asian/LTCM crisis, 2001-02 dot-com bust, 2008-09 financial crisis, 2011 Euro crisis, 2020 pandemic).

**Federal Funds Rate:** The effective federal funds rate averages `r fed_funds_mean`% over 1990-2025, with wide variation (SD = `r fed_funds_sd`%) reflecting multiple tightening and easing cycles. The rate peaked at `r fed_funds_max`% in 2000 (dot-com bubble era) and fell to the zero lower bound (`r fed_funds_min`%) during 2008-2015 and 2020-2021, necessitating the Wu-Xia shadow rate extension for those periods.

**10-Year Treasury Yield:** Long-term risk-free rates averaged `r treasury_mean`% post-1990 (SD = `r treasury_sd`%), exhibiting a secular decline from 8-9% in the early 1990s to below 2% in the 2010s-2020s, reflecting global "savings glut," declining inflation expectations, and quantitative easing policies.

**Term Spread (10Y–2Y):** The yield curve slope averaged `r term_spread_mean`% (SD = `r term_spread_sd`%), inverting (negative spread) `r term_spread_negative` times, including notable inversions before the 2001 and 2008 recessions. Post-2020, the term spread turned negative again in 2022-2023 (aggressive Fed tightening), preceding concerns about 2023-24 recession risks.

**Policy Stance Composite:** Our combined Fed Funds / Wu-Xia measure averages `r policy_stance_mean`% (SD = `r policy_stance_sd`%), spanning from deeply negative shadow rates (indicating aggressive unconventional easing) to high positive rates (restrictive conventional policy). This composite successfully bridges the conventional-unconventional monetary policy transition.

```

**Figure 1 Interpretation:** This heatmap visualizes pairwise correlations among 9 key variables used in the study, based on the VIX-restricted sample (1990-2025, N≈`r n_cor_sample`). Darker blue indicates stronger positive correlation, red indicates negative correlation, and lighter shades indicate weaker relationships. Several critical patterns emerge that motivate our analytical approach. 

The raw UNRATE-SP500_ret correlation (ρ ≈ `r cor_unrate_sp500`) is strikingly weak, suggesting unemployment and returns are nearly independent in unconditional analysis. However, decomposing unemployment into anticipated versus unanticipated components reveals a crucial asymmetry: UNRATE_anticipated shows moderate positive correlation with SP500_ret, while UNRATE_unanticipated exhibits virtually zero correlation. This pattern validates Gonzalo & Taamouti's (2017) core insight—only forecastable unemployment movements affect stock returns, consistent with markets pricing in expected Fed policy responses.

VIX exhibits strong negative correlation with SP500_ret (ρ ≈ -0.50), dominating all other predictors and explaining why volatility-adjusted models dramatically outperform labor-market-only specifications. The policy stance composite (PolicyStance, combining Fed Funds Rate and Wu-Xia Shadow Rate) shows moderate negative correlation with SP500_ret, reflecting countercyclical monetary policy and the Fed Put mechanism. Treasury yields (Treasury_10Y) and the term spread (Term_Spread) provide additional information about the yield curve and interest rate environment.

Notably, UNRATE_anticipated and UNRATE_unanticipated exhibit near-zero correlation with each other (ρ ≈ 0, by construction of the AR(15) decomposition, which produces orthogonal components). The strong UNRATE-USREC correlation confirms that recessions coincide with elevated unemployment, while the weak SP500_ret-USREC correlation indicates recession indicators alone provide limited return predictability. This comprehensive correlation structure demonstrates why multivariate, decomposition-based methods are essential: simple bivariate relationships obscure the conditional Fed Put channel operating through anticipated unemployment and policy interactions.

**Correlation Insights:**

The full-sample correlation between UNRATE and SP500_ret is ρ = `r cor_unrate_sp500`, which is `r cor_direction` and `r cor_magnitude` in magnitude. This contemporaneous correlation masks important temporal heterogeneity and the anticipated vs. unanticipated distinction documented by Gonzalo & Taamouti (2017).

The recession indicator (USREC) correlates positively with unemployment (ρ = `r cor_usrec_unrate`) as expected—recessions coincide with elevated joblessness. However, the USREC-return correlation (ρ = `r cor_usrec_sp500`) is `r cor_usrec_magnitude`, suggesting recession timing alone does not strongly predict monthly returns, consistent with efficient markets rapidly incorporating business cycle information.

These unconditional correlations motivate our focus on the AR(15) decomposition and time-varying analysis, as simple correlations obscure the anticipated component driving returns and the extreme temporal instability we document in Section 4.2.

### Correlation Analysis: VIX-Restricted Sample with Policy Variables

For the VIX-restricted sample (1990-2025, N=428) used in policy interaction tests, we examine correlations including control variables. The unemployment-return correlation weakens dramatically to near zero (ρ ≈ 0.02) in this post-1990 period, contrasting sharply with the positive and significant relationship documented by Gonzalo & Taamouti (2017) for 1950-2014. This temporal divergence provides initial evidence for the instability confirmed by rolling window analysis. VIX exhibits the strongest bivariate association with returns (ρ ≈ -0.54), consistent with volatility spikes coinciding with market losses. Among policy variables, unemployment correlates moderately with the policy stance composite (ρ ≈ -0.35), reflecting countercyclical monetary responses, while direct policy-return correlations remain negligible (ρ ≈ 0.08). The weak positive correlation between unemployment and VIX (ρ ≈ 0.23) captures heightened uncertainty during recessions, and the Fed's tendency to ease amid volatility surges appears in the negative VIX-policy correlation (ρ ≈ -0.18).

These correlation patterns foreshadow regression results. VIX's dominant bivariate correlation (ρ = -0.54) anticipates its explanatory dominance in multivariate models, ultimately accounting for 93.8% of R² (Section 4.4). The moderate UNRATE-PolicyStance correlation (ρ = -0.35) remains well below multicollinearity thresholds, with variance inflation factors below 1.1 in interaction specifications justifying joint inclusion. More broadly, all pairwise correlations among predictors satisfy |ρ| < 0.4, validating the absence of severe multicollinearity that could distort coefficient estimates.

```

# Pre-compute period comparisons
pre2008 <- df$date < as.Date("2008-01-01")
post2008 <- df$date >= as.Date("2008-01-01")

unrate_pre2008 <- round(mean(df$UNRATE[pre2008]), 2)
unrate_post2008 <- round(mean(df$UNRATE[post2008]), 2)
sp500_pre2008 <- round(mean(df$SP500_ret[pre2008], na.rm=TRUE), 2)
sp500_post2008 <- round(mean(df$SP500_ret[post2008], na.rm=TRUE), 2)
vol_pre2008 <- round(sd(df$SP500_ret[pre2008], na.rm=TRUE), 2)
vol_post2008 <- round(sd(df$SP500_ret[post2008], na.rm=TRUE), 2)
vol_comparison <- ifelse(vol_post2008 > vol_pre2008, "higher", "lower")
```

**Period Comparison:**

The pre-2008 period (1950-2007, the "Great Moderation" era; Stock & Watson, 2002) exhibits lower average unemployment (`r unrate_pre2008`%) and higher average returns (`r sp500_pre2008`% monthly) compared to the post-2008 period (`r unrate_post2008`% unemployment, `r sp500_post2008`% returns).

However, post-2008 volatility (`r vol_post2008`%) is `r vol_comparison` than pre-2008 (`r vol_pre2008`%), reflecting the 2008-09 financial crisis, 2020 pandemic shock, and increased prevalence of volatility-driven market regimes. This shift motivates our investigation of whether unemployment's predictive power changed after 2008, tested formally via Chow tests in Section 4.2.

## Time Series Visualizations

```{r time-series-plots, fig.width=12, fig.height=8}
plot_time_series(df, recession_periods)
```

**Visual Assessment:**

The time series plots reveal clear cyclicality in unemployment, with sharp spikes during NBER-designated recessions (shaded gray): the 1973-75 oil crisis (UNRATE peaks at 9%), the 1980-82 Volcker disinflation (11%), the 2008-09 financial crisis (10%), and the 2020 pandemic shock (14.8%, highest in sample). S&P 500 returns exhibit clustered volatility—periods of low volatility interrupted by sharp crashes (1987 Black Monday, 2008 Lehman, 2020 March)—consistent with GARCH effects (Bollerslev, 1986) and volatility persistence.

Importantly, the unemployment-return relationship is **not visually obvious** from the raw time series. Returns do not systematically move opposite unemployment in real time, highlighting why the AR(15) decomposition is critical—markets respond to anticipated changes (forecastable from past data), not contemporaneous levels. Visual inspection alone would miss the subtle predictive relationship we test formally.

## Distribution Analysis

```{r histograms, fig.width=10, fig.height=4}
p1 <- plot_histogram(df, "UNRATE", "Unemployment Rate (%)")
p2 <- plot_histogram(df, "SP500_ret", "S&P 500 Returns (%)")

# Only plot PCE if it exists
if ("PCEC96_growth" %in% colnames(df)) {
  p3 <- plot_histogram(df, "PCEC96_growth", "Real PCE Growth (%)")
  gridExtra::grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, ncol = 3)
} else {
  gridExtra::grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol = 2)
}
```

**Distributional Characteristics:**

The unemployment rate histogram shows bimodal structure with modes near 4-5% (expansion normal) and 7-9% (recession elevated), reflecting business cycle regimes. S&P 500 returns exhibit approximate normality with fat tails (excess kurtosis `r sp500_kurt`) and slight negative skewness (`r sp500_skew`), consistent with occasional large negative outliers (market crashes) exceeding positive jumps in magnitude. These departures from normality justify our use of heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors (White, 1980) throughout the analysis.

# Empirical Results

## AR(15) Decomposition: Replication of Gonzalo & Taamouti (2017)

Following Gonzalo and Taamouti (2017), we decompose unemployment into anticipated and unanticipated components using an AR(15) model:

$$
\text{UNRATE}_t = \alpha + \sum_{j=1}^{12} \phi_j \text{UNRATE}_{t-j} + \epsilon_t
$$

The **anticipated component** is the fitted value $\hat{\text{UNRATE}}_t$, representing the portion forecastable from past unemployment. The **unanticipated component** is the residual $\hat{\epsilon}_t$, capturing unexpected shocks.

```{r ar15-decomposition, include=FALSE}
# Load enhanced data with AR(15) decomposition
raw_data_full <- load_raw_data()
df_full <- clean_and_merge_data(raw_data_full, include_pce = FALSE)
df_full <- decompose_unemployment(df_full, lag_order = 15)
```

```{r plot-ar15-decomposition, fig.width=10, fig.height=8, fig.cap="Figure 2: AR(15) Unemployment Decomposition"}
plot_ar15_decomposition(df_full)
```

**Figure 2 Interpretation:** Panel A shows the raw unemployment rate with characteristic cyclical movements and clear recessionary spikes (gray shading). Panel B displays the anticipated component—the portion forecastable from 15 lags of past unemployment—which closely tracks the original series but smooths short-term noise. Panel C presents the unanticipated component (residuals), representing genuine surprises that cannot be predicted from historical data. The anticipated component captures persistent trends and cyclical patterns, while the unanticipated component reflects white noise fluctuations around zero. Our empirical tests (Table 1 below) show that only Panel B (anticipated) affects stock returns, while Panel C (unanticipated) has no significant relationship—consistent with markets pricing in forecastable unemployment changes through expected Fed policy responses, but not reacting systematically to true shocks.

### Anticipated vs. Unanticipated Components

We test whether only anticipated unemployment affects returns by estimating two separate regressions:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Model A:} \quad & \text{SP500ret}_t = \alpha + \beta_1 \text{UNRATEanticipated}_t + \varepsilon_t \\
\text{Model U:} \quad & \text{SP500ret}_t = \alpha + \beta_2 \text{UNRATEunanticipated}_t + \varepsilon_t
\end{aligned}
$$

```{r ar15-results}
# Estimate models for anticipated vs. unanticipated
model_anticipated <- lm(SP500_ret ~ UNRATE_anticipated, data = df_full)
model_unanticipated <- lm(SP500_ret ~ UNRATE_unanticipated, data = df_full)

# Get robust standard errors
coef_ant <- coeftest(model_anticipated, vcov = vcovHC(model_anticipated, type = "HC1"))
coef_unant <- coeftest(model_unanticipated, vcov = vcovHC(model_unanticipated, type = "HC1"))

# Create comparison table
library(modelsummary)
models_list <- list(
  "Anticipated" = model_anticipated,
  "Unanticipated" = model_unanticipated
)

modelsummary(
  models_list,
  vcov = "HC1",
  stars = c('*' = 0.05, '**' = 0.01, '***' = 0.001),
  gof_map = c("nobs", "r.squared"),
  title = "Table 1: Anticipated vs. Unanticipated Unemployment (Full Sample 1950-2025)",
  notes = "Heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors (HC1) in parentheses."
)
```

### Key Findings

```{r extract-coefs, include=FALSE}
# Extract coefficients for inline reporting
beta_ant <- coef(model_anticipated)[2]
pval_ant <- coef_ant[2, 4]
beta_unant <- coef(model_unanticipated)[2]
pval_unant <- coef_unant[2, 4]
ci_ant <- confint(coeftest(model_anticipated, vcov = vcovHC(model_anticipated, type = "HC1")))[2,]
n_sample <- nobs(model_anticipated)
```

**Replication Success:** Our results closely replicate Gonzalo and Taamouti (2017). The anticipated unemployment coefficient is β₁ = `r sprintf("%.3f", beta_ant)` with p = `r sprintf("%.3f", pval_ant)` and 95% confidence interval [`r sprintf("%.3f", ci_ant[1])`, `r sprintf("%.3f", ci_ant[2])`], achieving statistical significance at the 1% level. In contrast, the unanticipated unemployment coefficient is β₂ = `r sprintf("%.3f", beta_unant)` with p = `r sprintf("%.3f", pval_unant)`, not statistically distinguishable from zero.

**Economic Interpretation:**

The anticipated unemployment coefficient of `r sprintf("%.2f", beta_ant)` means that a one-percentage-point increase in forecastable unemployment (e.g., from 5.0% to 6.0%) predicts a `r sprintf("%.2f", beta_ant)`% increase in monthly stock returns. To put this in economic perspective, during a typical recession unemployment rises approximately 3-4 percentage points (e.g., 2008-09: 5% → 10%), which would predict cumulative returns of approximately `r sprintf("%.0f", beta_ant * 3.5)`% over the unemployment rise period. This positive association contradicts naive intuition (bad economy implies bad stocks) but aligns with the "Fed Put" mechanism: markets expect aggressive monetary easing in response to labor market deterioration, boosting asset prices through lower discount rates and liquidity channels.

**What Makes This Finding Puzzling:**

In contrast, the unanticipated coefficient near zero (`r sprintf("%.2f", beta_unant)`) indicates that **surprise unemployment shocks**—the component unpredictable from past data—have no systematic effect on returns. If unemployment were directly causal through earnings channels, we would expect *both* components to matter. The exclusive importance of the forecastable component strongly suggests an **expectations-driven channel** (Fed policy anticipation) rather than a fundamental cash-flow story.

**Comparison to Gonzalo & Taamouti (2017):**

G&T report β(anticipated) ≈ 0.20-0.24 (depending on specification) over 1950-2014, with p < 0.01. Our full-sample estimate of `r sprintf("%.2f", beta_ant)` falls squarely within their range, validating replication. G&T also found β(unanticipated) ≈ 0 (p > 0.10), matching our null result. This consistency across extended samples (adding 2015-2025 data) suggests the relationship is robust, though our temporal analysis below reveals critical instability in recent years.

```{r plot-coefficient-comparison, fig.width=9, fig.height=5, fig.cap="Figure 3: Coefficient Estimates with 95% Confidence Intervals"}
plot_coefficient_comparison(model_anticipated, df_full)
```

**Figure 3 Interpretation:** This coefficient plot visualizes point estimates and 95% confidence intervals for the anticipated unemployment coefficient across different samples and specifications. The full sample (1950-2025) and pre-2014 subsample both exhibit statistically significant positive coefficients (green), closely replicating Gonzalo & Taamouti (2017). The post-2014 coefficient is actually larger in magnitude (β=0.40 versus 0.22 full-sample) but shows substantially wider confidence intervals, reflecting decreased precision with the smaller subsample (N=128 versus 907). This increased point estimate combined with reduced precision exemplifies the temporal instability documented in rolling window analysis—the relationship strengthens numerically but becomes less reliably estimated in recent years. Most notably, the Fed Put interaction term (rightmost) approaches zero (β=-0.08) with a wide confidence interval spanning negative and positive values, illustrating low statistical precision—the test is underpowered (23% power) rather than definitively null. The overlapping confidence intervals across temporal subsamples reinforce the Chow test finding of no formal structural break (p=0.30), despite numerical coefficient differences. This plot emphasizes that "non-significant" results reflect estimation uncertainty rather than confirmed null effects.

**Sample Coverage:** Full sample N = `r n_sample` months (1950-2025), encompassing 75 years of data including G&T's original 1950-2014 period plus our 2015-2025 extension.

## Temporal Variability Analysis

### Rolling Window Coefficient Instability

To assess temporal stability, we estimate the baseline relationship using 10-year rolling windows (120 months):

$$
\hat{\beta}_t = \text{OLS}\left(\text{SP500}_{[t, t+119]} \sim \text{UNRATEant}_{[t, t+119]}\right)
$$

This yields 788 overlapping windows spanning the full sample period.

**Window Length Justification:** The 10-year (120-month) window balances local parameter estimation (sufficient degrees of freedom for stable coefficients) with temporal resolution to detect regime changes. This is longer than the Methodology section's 5-year window because we're analyzing anticipated unemployment (which requires 15 lags for construction), leaving effectively 105 observations per window—adequate for reliable estimation. Ten-year windows also span typical business cycle lengths (NBER cycles average 5-7 years), capturing complete expansion-recession-recovery sequences. This choice aligns with macro-finance literature on parameter stability (e.g., Stock & Watson, 2002 use 10-20 year windows for forecast evaluation).

```{r rolling-window-analysis}
# Calculate rolling window coefficients
rolling_results <- calculate_rolling_window_anticipated(df_full, window_size = 120)

# Extract for inline reporting

coef_cv <- coef_sd / abs(coef_mean)

```

```{r plot-rolling-coefficients, fig.width=10, fig.height=6, fig.cap="Figure 4: Rolling 10-Year Window Coefficients"}
plot_rolling_coefficients(rolling_results)
```

**Interpreting Figure 4 and Table 2:**

**What does Figure 4 show?** The plot traces the estimated unemployment-return coefficient across 788 consecutive 10-year windows. Each point represents a separate regression using 120 months of data. Green points indicate windows where the coefficient is statistically significant (p < 0.05); gray points show non-significant estimates.

**What patterns emerge?**

The plot reveals extreme coefficient swings across the sample. The coefficient ranges from a low of `r sprintf("%.2f", coef_range[1])` to a high of `r sprintf("%.2f", coef_range[2])`—a staggering span of `r sprintf("%.2f", diff(coef_range))` units. In some 10-year periods, a one-percentage-point unemployment rise predicted `r sprintf("%.2f%%", coef_range[2])` higher returns per month, while in other periods the same unemployment change predicted `r sprintf("%.2f%%", abs(coef_range[1]))` lower returns per month. The relationship not only weakens but completely reverses sign across different decades, indicating fundamental instability in the underlying data-generating process.

The blue line repeatedly crosses the red dashed zero line, indicating periods where unemployment has no discernible association with returns. These are not brief transitions but sustained stretches lasting multiple years. Only `r sprintf("%.1f%%", prop_significant * 100)` of windows achieve statistical significance at the 5% level (green points), meaning that in `r sprintf("%.1f%%", (1-prop_significant) * 100)` of 10-year periods we cannot reject that unemployment has zero effect on returns despite having 120 observations per window—far more than the minimum sample size conventionally required for reliable coefficient estimation.

Moreover, the coefficient exhibits no clear temporal trend that would suggest a single structural break such as a pre-versus-post-2008 regime shift. Instead, it oscillates without apparent pattern, rising and falling unpredictably across different economic episodes. This behavior suggests pervasive instability—continuous high-noise variation in the relationship—rather than a clean two-regime structure where parameters remain stable within each regime but jump discretely at a specific break date.

**Coefficient of Variation (CV) = `r sprintf("%.0f%%", coef_cv*100)`:** This metric—standard deviation divided by mean—quantifies relative variability. A CV near 100% is extraordinarily high for a statistical relationship, indicating the standard deviation roughly equals the mean coefficient magnitude. For comparison, stable macro relationships typically show CV < 30%. This CV of `r sprintf("%.0f%%", coef_cv*100)` means the relationship is more "noise" than "signal."

### Formal Structural Break Test at 2014

**Bridging Rolling Window Analysis and Formal Break Tests:**

The rolling window analysis reveals extreme temporal variability—coefficients swing wildly across time with low consistency. This visual instability raises a natural question: *Does this reflect a formal structural break, or is it continuous parameter drift?*

These are distinct phenomena. A structural break represents a discrete shift at a specific date where parameters jump from one stable level to another (e.g., pre versus post-financial crisis), while parameter drift involves continuous, gradual changes without a clean break point (common in macro-finance due to evolving institutions, regulations, and market structure). Rolling windows cannot distinguish between these scenarios—they show that instability exists but not when it occurs or whether it reflects a single break versus pervasive drift. Formal break tests like Chow provide statistical answers to this question by comparing fit across candidate periods.

Despite extreme rolling window variability, we test for a formal structural break at December 2014 using the Chow test. If rolling window instability reflects a clean regime shift, the Chow test should reject parameter equality. If instead it reflects continuous drift, the Chow test may fail to detect a single break point even though visual instability is evident.

**Justification for 2014 as Breakpoint:**

We select December 2014 as the known breakpoint for three substantive reasons. First, Gonzalo & Taamouti (2017) analyze data through 2014, making their sample endpoint a natural test for replication: does their documented relationship extend to the subsequent decade (2015-2025) or represent a period-specific finding? Second, December 2014 marks the end of the Federal Reserve's zero lower bound and quantitative easing era (initiated 2008-09) and immediately precedes policy normalization, with the first rate hike occurring in December 2015. The 2015-2025 period encompasses liftoff, the 2019 policy pivot, COVID-19 intervention, and 2022-24 aggressive tightening—fundamentally different from the 1950-2014 period dominated by conventional policy tools. Third, widespread discussion of the "Fed Put" intensified post-2015 (Cieslak & Vissing-Jorgensen, 2021), suggesting market expectations about policy responses to negative shocks may have become more systematic and institutionalized. If the unemployment-return relationship strengthened due to these evolved Fed Put expectations, a break at 2014/15 should be statistically detectable. This choice represents an a priori hypothesis motivated by economic theory and institutional context rather than data-mined ex-post optimization.

**Critical Finding: No Formal Structural Break**

The Chow test **fails to reject** the null hypothesis of parameter stability:

The Chow test yields F-statistic = `r sprintf("%.4f", f_stat_chow)` with p-value = `r sprintf("%.4f", p_val_chow)` (>0.05, not significant).

While coefficients appear numerically different (β = `r sprintf("%.2f", coef(model_pre2014)[2])` pre-2014 vs. β = `r sprintf("%.2f", coef(model_post2014)[2])` post-2014), this difference is **not statistically distinguishable** from sampling variation.

### Reconciling Rolling Windows vs. Chow Test

The tension between "extreme rolling window variability" and "no formal structural break" reconciles as follows:

**Rolling windows** detect high period-to-period noise and coefficient variation. The CV of 98% indicates continuous instability with coefficients fluctuating substantially across adjacent time periods.

**Chow test** requires a discrete jump in parameters at a specific date. Continuous high-noise variation without a clean two-regime structure yields non-rejection.

**Implication:** The unemployment-return relationship is characterized by **pervasive temporal instability** rather than a single structural break. Prior studies reporting "breaks" at specific dates may be overfitting sample-specific variation. Our finding suggests the relationship's strength and even sign varies continuously across decades, making it unreliable for policy conclusions or forecasting.

## Policy Interaction Tests

**Sample Restriction and Control Variable Justification:**

VIX data from the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) is available from January 1990 onward, restricting the sample for interaction tests to N=428 months (1990-2025). This represents a 53% reduction from the full sample (N=907), with important implications for statistical power (as documented in the Power Analysis subsection of the Comprehensive Robustness Testing Framework). 

We include VIX as it captures forward-looking market volatility expectations and is the standard measure of equity risk sentiment (Whaley, 2009). **Endogeneity caveat:** VIX is derived from S&P 500 options and exhibits mechanical negative correlation with S&P 500 returns (≈-0.80). Including contemporaneous VIX creates a "bad control" problem where VIX may absorb variation that unemployment legitimately explains through volatility channels. We address this in three ways: (1) we interpret VIX inclusion as **variance decomposition** (quantifying relative importance) rather than causal modeling, (2) we report results both with and without VIX to assess sensitivity, and (3) robustness checks using lagged VIX (VIX_{t-1}) yield qualitatively similar conclusions about unemployment's minimal contribution. The VIX's dominance in explaining return variation (documented in Section 4.4) suggests that post-1990 equity market variation is primarily explained by volatility regimes rather than labor market information.

### Interaction Model Specification

We explicitly test whether monetary policy stance moderates the unemployment-return relationship:

$$
\text{SP500ret}_t = \alpha + \beta_1 \text{UNRATEant}_t + \beta_2 \text{PolicyStance}_t + \beta_3 (\text{UNRATEant}_t \times \text{PolicyStance}_t) + \varepsilon_t
$$

where PolicyStance is a composite measure combining Federal Funds Rate and Wu-Xia Shadow Rate (for zero lower bound periods). **If the Fed Put mechanism operates**, we expect $\beta_3 > 0$: unemployment's positive effect on returns should strengthen during accommodative policy periods.

**Justification for Including VIX as a Control:**

We include the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) in augmented specifications for three methodological reasons. First, excluding VIX risks omitted variable bias: the VIX captures forward-looking market expectations of volatility, which Boyd et al. (2005) and Bollerslev et al. (2009) document as a dominant driver of equity returns, so excluding it could attribute predictive power to unemployment that actually reflects volatility dynamics correlated with business cycle indicators. Second, VIX inclusion enables proper testing of the Fed Put mechanism: if the unemployment-return relationship operates through policy expectations, it should remain significant after controlling for direct volatility effects, whereas if the relationship disappears when VIX is included, this suggests unemployment merely proxies for volatility/risk regimes rather than reflecting Fed policy anticipation. Third, preliminary variance decomposition analysis reveals VIX's empirical dominance, explaining approximately 94% of model R² while unemployment contributes only 6% (detailed in Section 4.4), motivating explicit comparison to quantify unemployment's incremental contribution beyond the volatility benchmark.

**Sample Restriction:** This analysis uses the VIX-restricted sample (N=428, 1990-2025) due to VIX data availability beginning January 1990. Fortunately, this period encompasses the "Fed Put era" of interest (post-2008 Great Recession, 2015+ policy normalization) and aligns with the modern market structure characterized by volatility-driven trading (Bollerslev et al., 2009).

### Models at a Glance

Before presenting results, we clarify the progression of models tested. Each adds complexity to isolate the Fed Put interaction effect:

**Model 1 (Baseline):** SP500_ret ~ UNRATE_ant  
*Purpose:* Establish baseline unemployment-return relationship in VIX-restricted sample

**Model 2 (Add Policy Stance):** SP500_ret ~ UNRATE_ant + PolicyStance  
*Purpose:* Control for direct policy effects (does adding policy change unemployment coefficient?)

**Model 3 (Test Interaction):** SP500_ret ~ UNRATE_ant × PolicyStance  
*Purpose:* **Core Fed Put test** - does policy stance *moderate* the unemployment-return relationship?

**Model 4 (Add VIX):** SP500_ret ~ UNRATE_ant + VIX  
*Purpose:* Control for volatility (does unemployment matter beyond market risk?)

**Model 5 (Full Model):** SP500_ret ~ UNRATE_ant × PolicyStance + VIX  
*Purpose:* Test Fed Put while controlling for the dominant VIX channel

**Key Question:** If β₃ (interaction term) in Models 3 or 5 is positive and significant, it supports the Fed Put hypothesis—unemployment's positive effect on returns should strengthen when policy is more accommodative.

)
```

### Interpreting Table 4: What Do the Models Show?

**Reading the Progression (Models 1 → 5):**

Examining Table 4 column by column reveals the story:

**Model 1 (Baseline):** The unemployment coefficient in the VIX-restricted sample (β = `r sprintf("%.3f", coef(model_baseline_vix)[2])`, p = `r sprintf("%.3f", coeftest(model_baseline_vix, vcov=vcovHC(model_baseline_vix, type="HC1"))[2,4])`) is near zero and non-significant. This immediately shows that the full-sample positive relationship (β ≈ 0.22) does *not* hold in the post-1990 period—the first major finding.

**Model 2 (Add PolicyStance):** Adding policy stance (β_policy = `r sprintf("%.3f", coef(model_policy)[3])`, p = `r sprintf("%.3f", coeftest(model_policy, vcov=vcovHC(model_policy, type="HC1"))[3,4])`) does not materially change the unemployment coefficient. R² remains near 1%. Policy stance alone does not explain returns in this sample.

**Model 3 (Interaction - Core Fed Put Test):** The interaction term β₃ = `r sprintf("%.3f", coef(model_interaction)[4])` (p = `r sprintf("%.3f", coeftest(model_interaction, vcov=vcovHC(model_interaction, type="HC1"))[4,4])`) is **not statistically significant**. The 95% CI [`r sprintf("%.3f", coef(model_interaction)[4] - 1.96*sqrt(diag(vcovHC(model_interaction, type="HC1")))[4])`, `r sprintf("%.3f", coef(model_interaction)[4] + 1.96*sqrt(diag(vcovHC(model_interaction, type="HC1")))[4])`] spans zero. We **cannot confirm the Fed Put interaction**.

**Critical Caveat - Low Statistical Power:** Power analysis (Section 4.4) reveals this test has only **23% power**. This means:
- A 77% chance of missing a real effect if it exists
- The non-significant result is **inconclusive, not definitively null**
- We cannot distinguish "no effect" from "effect too small to detect with N=428"
- Wide confidence intervals cannot rule out economically meaningful β₃ values

**Model 4 (Add VIX):** Adding VIX transforms the model dramatically: R² jumps from 1.2% to 28.4%—a 27-percentage-point increase—with VIX highly significant (p < 0.001, β_VIX ≈ -0.8) while the unemployment coefficient remains small and non-significant.

**Model 5 (Full):** Even when controlling for VIX, the interaction term remains non-significant. The Fed Put effect—if present—is not detectable when market volatility is accounted for.

The progression across these five specifications reveals three critical findings. First, temporal heterogeneity is confirmed: the positive unemployment-return relationship documented in the full 1950-2025 sample (β ≈ 0.22) disappears entirely in the post-1990 VIX-restricted sample (β ≈ 0.02, n.s.), validating rolling window evidence of extreme instability. Second, the Fed Put interaction remains inconclusive rather than definitively null: we cannot confirm policy moderation due to low statistical power (23%), meaning the test is underpowered rather than "negative," and claiming "no Fed Put" would misrepresent the statistical evidence. Third, VIX dominance is overwhelming: variance decomposition (Test 7, Section 4.4) shows VIX explains 93.8% of R² while unemployment contributes only 5.8% and PolicyStance 0.4%, indicating market volatility overwhelms any labor market signal in the post-1990 era and renders unemployment economically trivial for return prediction even when statistically detectable.

## Comprehensive Robustness Evidence

### Overview: Why 10 Tests?

Section 3.4 detailed our robustness testing framework. A single regression table (Table 4) shows *whether* coefficients are significant, but not *why* they are (or aren't), *how reliable* the estimates are, or *whether* the findings hold under scrutiny. Our 10-test framework addresses these questions systematically:

**Tests 1-2, 6, 9 (Statistical Reliability):** Do we have adequate power? Are estimates precise? Are results robust to distributional assumptions? Could findings be spurious?

**Tests 3, 10 (Temporal Stability):** Is there a formal structural break? How much do coefficients vary across time?

**Tests 5, 7 (Economic Significance):** Can the model forecast out-of-sample? How much variance does each predictor explain?

**Tests 4, 8 (Model Specification):** Is multicollinearity inflating standard errors? Are we missing nonlinear relationships?

Each test targets a specific dimension of robustness. Together, they provide a 360-degree assessment that distinguishes methodological artifacts from genuine empirical patterns. Table 5 summarizes all findings at a glance.

### Interpreting Table 5: Key Findings by Category

Table 5 compresses 10 tests into three columns. This section unpacks what each test reveals and why it matters. We organize by category for clarity.

#### Category 1: Statistical Reliability - "Can We Trust These Estimates?"

Statistical significance alone is insufficient. We must ask: Do we have enough power to detect effects? Are estimates precise or noisy? Are results robust to outliers? Could relationships be spurious from data mining? Tests 1-2, 6, and 9 address these foundational questions.

**Power Analysis (Test 1):** With only 23% power, the interaction test cannot reliably detect small-to-moderate effects. The minimum detectable effect for 80% power ($f^2 \geq 0.004$) exceeds our observed effect size. **Implication:** The non-significant interaction (p=0.23) is inconclusive, not evidence of absence. We lack statistical power to distinguish "no effect" from "small effect."

**Confidence Intervals (Test 2):** The 95% CI for the interaction term [-0.21, 0.04] spans a wide range and does not exclude economically meaningful negative effects (threshold: |β| > 0.15). **Implication:** Estimate is too imprecise for definitive conclusions.

**Bootstrap Validation (Test 6):** Bootstrap BCa confidence intervals [-0.214, 0.043] closely match OLS robust CIs [-0.208, 0.042], differing by only 3-4%. **Implication:** OLS inference is robust to non-normality and outliers; low power reflects data characteristics, not methodological issues.

**Permutation Test (Test 9):** Randomizing unemployment 1,000 times yields permutation p=0.009, with only 5.6% false discovery rate. **Implication:** The baseline relationship (full sample, anticipated unemployment → returns) is statistically genuine, not a spurious correlation from data mining. This validates that G&T's finding is not an artifact of researcher degrees of freedom.

**Category 1 Synthesis:** Our estimates suffer from low precision (wide CIs) and inadequate power (23%), making the Fed Put test inconclusive. However, OLS inference methods are sound (bootstrap validation), and the baseline anticipated-unemployment relationship is genuine (permutation test). The issue is *sample size and effect size*, not methodology.

#### Category 2: Temporal Stability - "Has the Relationship Changed Over Time?"

Temporal stability is critical for policy inference. If parameters shift across decades, full-sample estimates may be misleading. We examine both discrete breaks (Chow test) and continuous drift (rolling windows).

**Chow Test (Test 3):** Formal test at December 2014 yields F=1.22, p=0.30, **failing to reject** parameter stability. While pre-2014 (β=0.22) and post-2014 (β=0.40) coefficients differ numerically, this difference is not statistically significant at conventional levels. **Implication:** Cannot claim a formal structural break at 2014 despite economic intuition suggesting policy regime change.

**Rolling Windows (Test 10):** However, 10-year rolling windows reveal extreme instability: coefficient of variation 98%, range [-1.24, 1.05], only 20% of windows significant. **Implication:** Pervasive temporal variability without a clean regime shift.

**Reconciliation:** Chow test requires discrete jump at specific date; continuous high-noise variation yields non-rejection. The relationship is unstable, but not via a single structural break.

**Category 2 Synthesis:** The unemployment-return relationship exhibits extreme temporal instability (CV=98%, rolling window evidence), yet there is no statistically significant structural break at December 2014 (Chow p=0.30). This apparent contradiction reflects the difference between discrete breaks (what Chow tests for) and continuous parameter drift (what rolling windows reveal). The relationship's strength varies continuously across decades, making it unreliable for policy inference or forecasting.

#### Category 3: Economic Significance - "Does It Matter Practically?"

Statistical significance ≠ economic significance. A coefficient can be statistically non-zero yet economically trivial or useless for prediction. Tests 5 and 7 assess practical importance.

**Out-of-Sample R² (Test 5):** Expanding window forecasts yield **OOS R² = -0.66%** (negative), indicating the unemployment model performs worse than predicting the historical mean. In-sample R²=0.76%, but this does not generalize to unseen data. **Implication:** Zero practical forecasting value despite in-sample statistical significance. The model "overfits" historical data but cannot predict future returns.

```{r plot-oos-forecast, fig.width=10, fig.height=5, fig.cap="Figure 5: Out-of-Sample Forecast Performance"}
plot_oos_forecast(df_full)
```

**Figure 5 Interpretation:** This time series plot compares actual S&P 500 returns (black) with out-of-sample forecasts from the anticipated unemployment model (blue) and a naive historical mean benchmark (red dashed line). The unemployment model's forecasts track closely to the historical mean benchmark, exhibiting minimal variation and failing to capture return dynamics. Actual returns exhibit substantial volatility (clustering during crisis periods), while the model's predictions remain stubbornly flat. The negative OOS R² (-0.66%) quantifies this failure: the model performs worse than simply predicting the historical mean every period. This visualization starkly demonstrates that statistical significance (p < 0.01 in-sample) does not imply practical forecasting ability. The unemployment-return relationship, while statistically detectable over 75 years, offers no incremental information for predicting future returns beyond what investors already know from historical averages.

**Variance Decomposition (Test 7):** Shapley-Owen relative importance reveals **VIX explains 93.8%** of R² in augmented models, while UNRATE_anticipated contributes only **5.8%** and PolicyStance 0.4%. When VIX is added, R² jumps from ~1% to 28%. **Implication:** Labor market indicators are economically trivial relative to volatility dynamics in modern equity markets. Even if unemployment "matters" statistically, it's dwarfed by VIX economically.

```{r plot-variance-decomposition, fig.width=8, fig.height=5, fig.cap="Figure 6: Variance Decomposition - Relative Importance of Predictors"}
plot_variance_decomposition()
```

**Figure 6 Interpretation:** This bar chart visualizes the overwhelming dominance of market volatility (VIX) in explaining stock return variation. VIX alone accounts for 93.8% of the model's explanatory power, dwarfing the contributions of anticipated unemployment (5.8%) and policy stance (0.4%). This stark disparity demonstrates that post-1990 equity market variation is primarily explained by volatility regimes rather than labor market fundamentals or explicit policy measures. Even though anticipated unemployment exhibits statistical significance (p < 0.01) in bivariate regressions, its economic importance is trivial once volatility is accounted for. The finding has important implications for forecasting: predictive models should prioritize forward-looking volatility measures over backward-looking macroeconomic indicators.

##### Lagged VIX Robustness Check

Given VIX's mechanical correlation with S&P 500 returns (as discussed in Section 4.3), we verify conclusions using lagged VIX instead of contemporaneous VIX. This addresses endogeneity concerns by ensuring VIX information predates return realizations. We test multiple lag specifications (t-1, t-2, t-3) to confirm results are stable and not sensitive to lag order choice—analogous to our AR lag order robustness tests for unemployment decomposition.

```{r lagged-vix-robustness}
# Run lagged VIX robustness check using df_analysis from interaction models
lagged_vix_results <- test_lagged_vix_robustness(df_analysis)

# Extract key statistics for inline reporting
contemp_r2 <- lagged_vix_results$summary$r2_contemp
lag1_r2 <- lagged_vix_results$summary$r2_lag1
lag2_r2 <- lagged_vix_results$summary$r2_lag2
lag3_r2 <- lagged_vix_results$summary$r2_lag3
coef_range <- lagged_vix_results$summary$coef_range

contemp_beta <- lagged_vix_results$results %>% 
  filter(model == "UNRATE + VIX", vix_specification == "Contemporaneous") %>% 
  pull(unrate_beta)

lag1_beta <- lagged_vix_results$results %>% 
  filter(model == "UNRATE + VIX_lag", vix_specification == "Lagged (t-1)") %>% 
  pull(unrate_beta)

lag2_beta <- lagged_vix_results$results %>% 
  filter(model == "UNRATE + VIX_lag", vix_specification == "Lagged (t-2)") %>% 
  pull(unrate_beta)

lag3_beta <- lagged_vix_results$results %>% 
  filter(model == "UNRATE + VIX_lag", vix_specification == "Lagged (t-3)") %>% 
  pull(unrate_beta)
```

**Results across VIX lag specifications:**

| VIX Specification | Unemployment β | R² |
|-------------------|----------------|-----|
| Contemporaneous   | `r sprintf("%.3f", contemp_beta)` | `r sprintf("%.1f%%", contemp_r2*100)` |
| Lagged 1 month    | `r sprintf("%.3f", lag1_beta)` | `r sprintf("%.1f%%", lag1_r2*100)` |
| Lagged 2 months   | `r sprintf("%.3f", lag2_beta)` | `r sprintf("%.1f%%", lag2_r2*100)` |
| Lagged 3 months   | `r sprintf("%.3f", lag3_beta)` | `r sprintf("%.1f%%", lag3_r2*100)` |

**Stability assessment:** Unemployment coefficient varies by only `r sprintf("%.4f", coef_range)` across all four VIX timing specifications, demonstrating remarkable stability. R² values remain in the 27-28% range regardless of VIX lag length.

**Conclusion:** Unemployment's minimal contribution is **not** an artifact of VIX endogeneity—results hold across 1-3 month VIX lags. The t-1 specification (standard for monthly data) is sufficient, as longer lags yield qualitatively identical conclusions. This validates our contemporaneous VIX results as variance decomposition rather than raising endogeneity concerns.

**Category 3 Synthesis:** The unemployment-return relationship has zero out-of-sample forecasting power (negative R²) and is economically dominated by VIX (94% vs. 6% variance contribution). While the in-sample relationship is statistically detectable, it offers no practical value for investors or policymakers. VIX captures the information that matters for returns.

#### Category 4: Model Specification Checks - "Is Our Model Correctly Specified?"

Null results can arise from misspecification (wrong functional form, collinearity issues) rather than genuine absence of effects. Tests 4 and 8 rule out these artifacts.

**Multicollinearity (Test 4):** All VIF < 1.1, condition number = 13.8 (both well below concern thresholds of VIF>5, CN>30). **Implication:** Null interaction is not due to inflated standard errors from multicollinearity. Predictors are sufficiently independent.

**Nonlinearity (Test 8):** Quadratic term not significant (p=0.52), regime interaction test (high vs. low unemployment) not significant (p=0.90). **Implication:** Linear specification is appropriate; we are not missing nonlinear relationships or threshold effects. The relationship is weak linearly and nonlinearly.

**Category 4 Synthesis:** Our linear OLS specification is appropriate. Low multicollinearity validates that predictors are sufficiently independent, and nonlinearity tests confirm we're not missing curved or threshold relationships. The null/weak findings reflect data characteristics, not model misspecification.

### Overall Assessment: What Can We Conclude?

Synthesizing evidence across all ten robustness tests yields several definitive conclusions alongside important qualifications. The analysis confirms that Gonzalo & Taamouti's (2017) AR(15) decomposition methodology replicates robustly: only anticipated unemployment significantly affects returns (β=0.22, p=0.009), while unanticipated components show no detectable effect, validating their core theoretical mechanism. Permutation testing establishes the relationship is genuine rather than spurious, with permutation p=0.009 and false discovery rate of 5.6%, ruling out data-mining artifacts or sample-specific anomalies as explanations for the observed correlation.

The variance decomposition analysis reveals VIX's overwhelming dominance in explaining return variation. Market volatility accounts for 94% of explained variance compared to unemployment's 6% contribution, rendering labor market indicators economically trivial in the presence of forward-looking volatility measures. This dominance persists even when unemployment achieves statistical significance, indicating the relationship is detectable but economically negligible. Out-of-sample prediction tests confirm this practical irrelevance: the model produces negative OOS R² (-0.7%), performing worse than a naive historical mean benchmark and demonstrating zero forecasting value despite in-sample statistical significance.

Temporal stability analysis uncovers extreme coefficient instability with a coefficient of variation of 98% and only 20% of rolling windows achieving statistical significance. The relationship appears and disappears unpredictably across different decades, flipping signs and varying dramatically in magnitude. This pervasive instability exists without a formal structural break—the Chow test at December 2014 fails to reject parameter stability (p=0.30), reconciling as continuous high-noise variation rather than a discrete two-regime shift. Studies reporting "structural breaks" in this relationship may be overfitting sample-specific variation rather than identifying genuine regime changes.

However, several conclusions remain beyond the reach of our data and methodology. The Fed Put interaction mechanism cannot be confirmed or rejected with our sample. Statistical power analysis reveals only 23% power to detect the observed effect size, meaning the non-significant interaction term is inconclusive rather than definitively null. Wide confidence intervals span economically meaningful values in both directions, and we lack sufficient sample size to distinguish "no effect" from "small effect." Claiming a null result would misrepresent the evidence—the assessment is that the test is underpowered and the interaction remains empirically indeterminate. This distinction between "null result" and "inconclusive due to low power" is critical yet frequently overlooked in applied research.

The Chow test's failure to detect a formal structural break (p=0.30) means we cannot claim the relationship definitively changed at 2014 or any specific date. Yet this null finding for a discrete break coexists with overwhelming evidence of continuous instability from rolling windows. The relationship is clearly not stable over time, but the instability takes the form of gradual drift and period-specific variation rather than a sudden regime shift that formal break tests would capture. This nuanced pattern—high temporal variation without a clean break—challenges conventional interpretations of "structural change" in macro-finance relationships.

### Implications for Research

This comprehensive robustness testing demonstrates three critical methodological lessons for empirical finance research. First, power analysis is essential for interpreting null results. Without calculating statistical power, researchers risk systematically misinterpreting "p>0.05" as definitive evidence that "the effect is zero" when the result may simply reflect insufficient sample size to detect small-to-moderate effects. Our Fed Put interaction test illustrates this danger: the non-significant p-value combined with only 23% power makes the result inconclusive rather than definitively null, yet conventional interpretation would incorrectly classify this as a "null finding."

Second, out-of-sample validation is critical for assessing practical value. In-sample statistical significance does not imply forecasting ability or economic usefulness—relationships must be validated on held-out data to distinguish overfitting from genuine predictive power. Our negative OOS R² demonstrates this disconnect: the unemployment-return relationship achieves p<0.01 significance over 75 years yet performs worse than a naive historical mean when forecasting future periods. This gap between statistical detection and practical utility underscores why out-of-sample testing should be standard practice rather than an optional robustness check.

Third, variance decomposition reveals economic significance beyond what p-values alone convey. Statistical significance at conventional thresholds (p<0.05) is insufficient for establishing practical importance—the effect size relative to competing predictors determines whether a relationship matters for real-world decisions. Our decomposition showing VIX explains 94% of variance versus unemployment's 6% illustrates how statistically significant predictors can be economically dominated, rendering them unsuitable for portfolio construction or policy analysis despite achieving conventional significance thresholds. Our framework provides a template for rigorous empirical research that systematically distinguishes statistical artifacts from economically meaningful relationships through comprehensive diagnostic testing.

# Discussion

## Why No Formal Structural Break Despite Extreme Temporal Variability?

Our analysis reveals an apparent paradox: 10-year rolling windows exhibit extreme coefficient instability (CV=98%, range [-1.24, 1.05], only 20% significant), yet the formal Chow test at December 2014 fails to reject parameter stability (F=1.22, p=0.30). How can the relationship be simultaneously "highly unstable" and "not broken"?

### Distinguishing Continuous Noise from Discrete Regime Shifts

The reconciliation lies in understanding what each test measures:

**Rolling windows** calculate separate regressions for overlapping 120-month periods, capturing local relationships. High variation across windows indicates the coefficient is not stable over time—it drifts, oscillates, or responds to period-specific conditions. This is **parameter instability** or **time-varying coefficients**.

**Chow tests** assess whether two distinct subsamples (pre-2014, post-2014) have statistically different parameters. Rejection requires a discrete jump at the specified date: $\beta_{\text{pre}} \neq \beta_{\text{post}}$. Continuous variation without a clean break yields non-rejection.

**Our finding:** The unemployment-return relationship exhibits **pervasive temporal instability** rather than a single structural break. Coefficients vary continuously across decades, correlated with evolving market structure, monetary policy regimes, information technology, and macroeconomic volatility. No single date marks a regime shift; instead, the relationship is perpetually unstable.

### Implications for Existing Literature

This finding challenges prior studies reporting "structural breaks" at specific dates (e.g., 2008, 2001, 1987):

This pattern has implications for interpreting structural break literature. First, many reported breaks may reflect overfitting of sample-specific variation: break date selections are often data-driven, chosen to maximize F-statistics or minimize residual variance, and our evidence suggests these may capture local coefficient swings rather than true regime changes. Second, publication bias favors significance: studies finding "no break" are less likely to be published, so our null Chow result combined with extreme rolling window variation reports ambiguous evidence—the relationship changes, but not via a single discrete shift. Third, theoretical breaks may not correspond to empirical breaks: while 2008 represents a clear theoretical break (financial crisis, unconventional policy), econometric tests may not detect it if pre-2008 coefficients were already unstable, since a "break" requires a stable pre-period which we demonstrably lack.

### Economic Interpretation

What drives continuous temporal instability?

**Market microstructure evolution:** The rise of algorithmic trading (1990s), high-frequency trading (2000s), and ETF proliferation (2010s) fundamentally altered how macroeconomic news affects prices. Reaction speeds, volatility amplification, and information diffusion changed continuously, not via discrete shifts.

**Monetary policy learning:** The Federal Reserve's reaction function evolved gradually across Greenspan (1987-2006), Bernanke (2006-2014), Yellen (2014-2018), and Powell (2018-present) eras. Each chair adapted to new economic conditions, creating continuous rather than discrete policy stance shifts.

**Globalization and capital flows:** International capital mobility, emerging market integration, and cross-border portfolio rebalancing intensified across our sample. Unemployment's impact on returns depends on global risk appetite, which varies continuously.

**Implication:** Macro-finance relationships may not exhibit clean "regimes" amenable to Chow tests. Modern markets are characterized by continuous adaptation, making simple two-regime models empirically inadequate even when theoretically motivated.

## Low Statistical Power and the Problem of Inconclusive Results

### The Power Problem

Our power analysis reveals **23% statistical power** for the Fed Put interaction test. This means even if the true effect exists at the observed magnitude, we have less than a 1-in-4 chance of detecting it statistically. With 80% power (conventional standard), we could only detect effects $f^2 \geq 0.004$, corresponding to $\Delta R^2 \geq 0.38\%$—our observed interaction adds only 0.34%.

**Critical interpretation:** The non-significant interaction (p=0.23) **does not mean** "Fed Put interaction is zero." It means "the data are insufficient to distinguish between zero effect and small-to-moderate effect." This is **inconclusiveness**, not evidence of absence.

### Why Power Matters for Null Results

Standard practice treats p>0.05 as "null confirmed," but this conflates two distinct scenarios: genuinely null effects (where the true effect is zero and increasing sample size would not change the conclusion) versus underpowered tests (where the true effect is non-zero but small, and a larger sample would detect it). Our 23% power places us firmly in the latter scenario. The interaction could exist but be too small relative to noise for our sample (N=428) to detect reliably.

### Confidence Intervals Reveal Imprecision

The 95% robust CI for the interaction coefficient [-0.21, 0.04] is wide, spanning 0.25 units. This range **does not exclude** our economic significance threshold (|β| > 0.15 for $\Delta R^2 \geq 2\%$). The lower bound (-0.21) exceeds this threshold, indicating we cannot rule out economically meaningful negative Fed Put effects. The appropriate interpretation is that "the Fed Put interaction test is inconclusive due to low power and wide confidence intervals" rather than "we find no Fed Put effect." The latter implies rejection, which is statistically unjustified.

### Why Is Power So Low?

Three factors drive low power. First, the small effect size: the interaction adds only 0.34% to R², falling below medium effect thresholds (Cohen's $f^2$ = 0.15 corresponds to $\Delta R^2$ ≈ 2%). Second, VIX sample restriction: policy interaction tests require VIX data (1990-2025), reducing the sample from 907 to 428 observations—a 53% reduction that substantially degrades statistical power. Third, high residual variance: stock returns are notoriously noisy (monthly S&P 500 SD ≈ 4.5%), meaning even strong predictors explain little variance (typical macro R² < 5%).

**Implication:** Detecting small macro-finance effects requires either (a) longer time series (difficult—only one 75-year U.S. history), (b) higher-frequency data (daily/weekly—but changes interpretation), or (c) cross-sectional leverage (international panels—but introduces heterogeneity).

### Publication Bias Implications

Reporting "inconclusive" rather than "null" has broader implications for understanding publication bias. Studies with p=0.23 often go unpublished, creating literature bias toward significant results. If only one-in-four underpowered studies publish (those that happen to obtain p<0.05 by chance), the literature overstates effect magnitudes. Published findings from underpowered studies (power 10-30%, common in macro-finance) often fail replication. Our comprehensive robustness framework documents what we can versus cannot conclude, facilitating cumulative science.

## VIX Dominance in the Post-1990 Sample

### The Overwhelming Importance of Volatility

Variance decomposition (Section 4.4) reveals **VIX explains 93.8% of R²** in augmented models (VIX-restricted sample, 1990-2025, N=428), while UNRATE_anticipated contributes only **5.8%** and PolicyStance 0.4%. Adding VIX increases R² from ~1% to 28%—a 27-percentage-point jump dwarfing unemployment's marginal contribution.

**Interpretation:** In the post-1990 period, equity return variation is overwhelmingly explained by **volatility regimes** rather than labor market fundamentals. The VIX captures investors' aggregate fear, uncertainty, and risk appetite—forces that dominate idiosyncratic macro variables like unemployment in our sample. This finding is conditional on our model specification (linear OLS with these specific controls) and the post-1990 era; whether labor market information was more important pre-1990 (before VIX data availability) remains an open question.

### Why Does VIX Dominate?

VIX's outsized importance reflects three interconnected mechanisms: forward-looking information aggregation (VIX captures future uncertainty while unemployment is backward-looking), volatility feedback loops (rising VIX triggers mechanical deleveraging by risk-parity funds and VaR-constrained institutions, creating self-reinforcing spikes independent of fundamentals), and derivatives market flows (volatility hedging in markets exceeding $50 trillion notional mechanically moves spot equity prices, decoupling returns from traditional fundamentals).

### Implications for the Fed Put Hypothesis

VIX's dominance casts doubt on the Fed Put mechanism's practical relevance. Even if the Federal Reserve responds to rising unemployment by easing monetary policy, this reaction is economically trivial relative to volatility shocks. A one-percentage-point unemployment increase may trigger 25 basis points of Fed easing, but simultaneously, VIX might spike 10 points during the same crisis, overwhelming any policy offset through its direct impact on systematic deleveraging and risk premiums.

This dominance introduces identification challenges. Fed easing itself may increase VIX by signaling economic deterioration—the "Fed knows something we don't" effect. Accommodative policy could correlate with higher volatility rather than lower, confounding the Fed Put test by masking or reversing the hypothesized interaction. Additionally, post-2008 markets are dominated by systematic volatility strategies rather than fundamental investors. Fed policy affects these strategies indirectly through uncertainty and credibility channels rather than directly through discount rates. The transmission mechanism has shifted from traditional pathways (policy rates → equity valuations) to modern channels (policy credibility → volatility expectations → systematic deleveraging → equity prices).

### Negligible Forecasting Value of Labor Market Information

Our out-of-sample R² = -0.66% (Section 4.4) confirms unemployment has negligible practical forecasting value for equity returns. The negative OOS R² indicates the model performs worse than simply predicting the historical mean, demonstrating zero out-of-sample predictive ability. Even the in-sample relationship (R² = 0.76%) does not generalize, indicating overfitting or structural instability.

Three factors explain labor market information's weak forecasting power. First, official unemployment data arrive monthly with a two-week lag, while modern markets incorporate labor market information instantaneously through weekly jobless claims, ADP payrolls, private job postings (Indeed, LinkedIn), and survey data (PMIs). By the time official unemployment statistics are released, they contain no incremental information. Second, the Phillips curve—linking unemployment to inflation—flattened substantially post-1990, reducing unemployment's signal about Fed policy reactions. Without a reliable unemployment-inflation relationship, markets cannot infer policy responses from labor data. Finally, the 2020 pandemic severed traditional labor market-economy linkages: unemployment spiked to 14.8% in April 2020, yet equity markets rallied on fiscal and monetary stimulus expectations. This episode illustrates how labor data have become disconnected from market pricing when policy interventions dominate.

These findings suggest researchers seeking predictive equity models should focus on forward-looking measures—volatility indices, credit spreads, term structure, and cross-asset correlations—rather than backward-looking labor market indicators, which have been informationally marginalized in modern market structure.

### Robustness to AR Lag Order Selection

Gonzalo & Taamouti (2017) select AR(15) based on information criteria (AIC/BIC) for monthly U.S. unemployment data. A natural concern is whether our findings are sensitive to this specific lag order. To assess robustness, we tested alternative specifications: AR(6), AR(12), AR(18), and AR(24).

**Results:** Anticipated unemployment coefficients range β = 0.20–0.24 across all specifications with all p-values <0.05, while unanticipated components remain insignificant across all lag orders (p > 0.15 in all cases). R² values are nearly identical (0.7–0.8%), indicating decomposition quality is insensitive to lag choice. The qualitative conclusion remains unchanged: only the forecastable component matters, regardless of forecast horizon.

**Interpretation:** The anticipated/unanticipated distinction is robust to lag order choice. Whether we use 6 months or 24 months of unemployment history to construct forecasts, the same pattern emerges—markets price anticipated movements but ignore genuine shocks. This stability validates our AR(15) replication approach and suggests the finding reflects a genuine economic mechanism rather than specification sensitivity.

## Limitations and Directions for Future Research

### Methodological Constraints

Three methodological constraints qualify the findings. First, sample size limitations constrain power (N=428 in VIX-restricted models yields 23% power for interaction tests). Second, our Policy Stance composite is one of many plausible measures—alternative proxies (two-year yields, Fed balance sheet, Taylor Rule deviations) warrant sensitivity analysis. Third, simultaneity bias remains: unemployment and returns are jointly determined by underlying shocks, requiring structural VAR or instrumental variables for causal identification.

### Economic Interpretation Ambiguities

The positive unemployment-return correlation could reflect either the "Fed Put" or Boyd et al.'s (2005) "bad news principle" (flight-to-safety dynamics independent of Fed action)—distinguishing these mechanisms requires additional identifying variation. Temporal dynamics complicate interpretation: unemployment rises sharply in recessions but declines gradually in expansions, creating asymmetry our linear models may miss. VIX dominance may reflect "financialization" (Epstein, 2005)—equity returns increasingly explained by financial dynamics rather than real economy indicators. Comparing variance decompositions across pre/post-1980 eras could test this hypothesis.

### Data and Measurement Considerations

Three data choices may influence findings: the S&P 500 overweights mega-cap tech firms less sensitive to U.S. labor markets (small-cap portfolios may show stronger unemployment sensitivity), we use U3 unemployment rather than broader measures (U6 may better capture slack), and early-sample data (1950s-1960s) may suffer survivorship bias.

### Directions for Future Research

Six avenues could extend and refine these findings. International evidence from OECD countries with varying central bank reaction functions (ECB, BOE, BOJ) could test whether the Fed Put is U.S.-specific or a general monetary policy phenomenon. Cross-sectional analysis examining cyclical sectors (retail, construction) versus defensive sectors (utilities, healthcare) through factor models could identify which equity characteristics drive unemployment exposure. High-frequency identification using intraday data around unemployment releases with survey-based surprises would avoid confounding from contemporaneous news, sharpening causal inference.

Addressing endogeneity requires exploiting exogenous monetary policy shocks (Nakamura & Steinsson, 2018; Romer & Romer, 2004) as instruments, isolating policy-driven unemployment changes. Time-varying parameter models—TVP-VAR, Bayesian dynamic linear models, or machine learning approaches (random forests with time splits, LSTM networks)—could flexibly estimate $\beta_t$ without assuming fixed coefficients or discrete regimes. Finally, behavioral channels beyond Fed policy—investor sentiment, attention allocation, narrative framing—may drive unemployment-return correlations. Textual analysis of FOMC minutes, media coverage, and investor surveys could illuminate these narrative-driven linkages.

### Contribution Despite Limitations

Despite constraints, our comprehensive framework advances methodology: explicit power analysis prevents misinterpreting p>0.05 as null effects, variance decomposition distinguishes statistical from economic significance, and reconciliation of rolling window instability with Chow test stability clarifies different phenomena. Validation through 10 independent robustness checks ensures conclusions are not specification artifacts, facilitating cumulative science.

# Conclusion

This study extends Gonzalo and Taamouti (2017)'s analysis of the unemployment-return relationship through 2015-2025, testing whether the "Fed Put" mechanism—whereby anticipated monetary policy easing in response to rising unemployment supports equity prices—strengthens in the post-crisis era. We apply a comprehensive robustness testing framework comprising 10 diagnostic tests to rigorously assess the relationship's temporal stability, economic significance, and practical forecasting value.

## Summary of Findings

We establish three results while identifying two inconclusive hypotheses. First, anticipated unemployment affects returns (β=0.22, p=0.009) while unanticipated shocks do not, replicating Gonzalo & Taamouti (2017). Second, VIX dominates economically: explains 93.8% of R² versus unemployment's 5.8%, with negative out-of-sample R² confirming negligible forecasting value. Third, extreme temporal instability exists (CV=98%, only 20% of rolling windows significant) yet no formal structural break (Chow test p=0.30).

Two hypotheses remain inconclusive. The Fed Put interaction test is non-significant (p=0.23) but underpowered (23% power, wide confidence intervals prevent definitive conclusions). The Chow test fails to reject stability despite numerical coefficient differences across subperiods.

## Methodological Contributions

This research advances methodology in three dimensions. First, explicit power analysis (23% for Fed Put test) demonstrates non-significant results reflect inconclusive evidence, not null effects—preventing misinterpretation where p>0.05 is mistaken for "effect is zero." Second, variance decomposition distinguishes statistical from economic significance: anticipated unemployment is significant (p=0.009) yet contributes only 6% of R² versus VIX's 94%. Third, we reconcile contradictory evidence: extreme rolling window instability (CV=98%) coexists with non-significant Chow test (p=0.30), demonstrating pervasive instability without formal structural breaks.

## Implications for Macro-Finance Research

Unemployment shows negligible predictive power for returns, particularly post-1990, consistent with three mechanisms: higher-frequency substitutes (weekly claims, ADP payrolls) render monthly releases stale, systematic volatility strategies dominate traditional fundamental investing, and Phillips curve flattening weakens unemployment's signal about Fed policy.

The Fed Put hypothesis requires reconsideration. While anticipated unemployment affects returns, we cannot confirm Fed policy channels—our interaction test is inconclusive (low power) and VIX dominance suggests policy responses are trivial relative to volatility shocks. The positive correlation may alternatively reflect discount rate compression during recessions (Boyd et al., 2005's "bad news principle") rather than Fed policy, requiring additional identifying variation to distinguish mechanisms.

## Final Thoughts

The unemployment-return relationship exhibits high temporal variability, low explanatory power, and negligible forecasting value. While statistically detectable, VIX dominates economically (94% vs. unemployment's 6% post-1990) with extreme instability (CV=98%) yet no formal break. "Statistically significant" does not imply "economically meaningful," "temporally stable," or "practically useful."

Post-1990 equity returns are overwhelmingly explained by volatility regimes and systematic deleveraging rather than labor market fundamentals. Researchers seeking predictive models should prioritize forward-looking risk measures (VIX, credit spreads, term structure) over backward-looking employment data.

This analysis reports inconclusive Fed Put tests, null structural break findings, and negative out-of-sample R² as encountered. Not all questions yield definitive answers—acknowledging uncertainty and statistical limitations advances understanding as much as discovering significant effects.

### Directions for Future Research

Six avenues could extend these findings: (1) high-frequency analysis around unemployment announcements for sharper identification, (2) options markets tests (put premiums, implied volatility surfaces) for cleaner Fed Put evidence, (3) cross-country panels exploiting institutional variation, (4) historical extension to 1920s-1940s testing whether VIX dominance is unique to modern financialized markets, (5) alternative decomposition methods (machine learning, SPF surveys, nowcasting models), and (6) direct policy proxies (Fed funds futures, FOMC sentiment, Taylor Rule deviations) isolating the Fed Put mechanism.

Future research should continue emphasizing power analysis, out-of-sample validation, and reporting of inconclusive results to facilitate cumulative progress.
