## Project Summary

### Research Question

Does unemployment predict stock returns? If so, has this relationship changed in the post-2008 era of unconventional monetary policy (the "Fed Put")?

### Motivation

Classic asset pricing theory (Campbell & Shiller, 1988; Fama, 1990) suggests higher unemployment should depress stock returns via lower expected earnings. However, Boyd et al. (2005) document the opposite: bad unemployment news is often good for stocks. This paradox may reflect Federal Reserve responses (lower interest rates boost valuations) or time-varying risk premia. We systematically investigate these competing channels and test for structural breaks around December 2014 (end of Fed taper).

### Key Findings

1. **Anticipated unemployment positively predicts returns** (β = 0.22, p = 0.02)
   - Higher expected unemployment → higher stock returns
   
2. **Unanticipated unemployment (surprises) do not matter** (β = -0.02, p = 0.92)
   - Markets only respond to forecastable component, not shocks
   
3. **No formal structural break** (Chow test: p = 0.30)
   - Relationship is pervasively unstable (CV = 98%) but no discrete regime shift
   
4. **Negative out-of-sample R² (-0.7%)**
   - Unemployment has zero practical forecasting power
   
5. **Low statistical power (23%)** to detect modest effects
   - Non-significant interaction terms may reflect Type II errors

### Contributions

- **AR(15) decomposition** of unemployment into anticipated/unanticipated components following Gonzalo & Taamouti (2017), extended through 2025
  
- **Formal Chow test** for structural breaks at theoretically motivated date (December 2014), reconciled with rolling window evidence
  
- **Explicit Fed Put tests** via policy interaction terms (Fed Funds × Unemployment)
  
- **Comprehensive testing:**
  1. Statistical power analysis
  2. Bootstrap confidence intervals  
  3. Structural break testing
  4. Multicollinearity diagnostics
  5. Out-of-sample prediction
  6. Shapley-Owen variance decomposition
  7. Nonlinearity tests (quadratic, threshold)
  8. Permutation tests
  9. Alternative lag specifications
  10. Rolling window stability analysis

## Reproducibility

This project follows best practices for computational reproducibility:

1. **Automated Data Acquisition:** All data downloaded programmatically from stable public sources (FRED, Yahoo Finance). No manual downloads required.

2. **Modular Code Design:** All analysis functions isolated in R/ folder, sourced by main RMD. Each function is documented and independently testable.

3. **Version Control:** Full project hosted on GitHub:  
   https://github.com/aeri-rt/unemployment-stock-returns

2. Compare outputs to provided `Report_Trinh.html`
3. Results should be identical (except Wu-Xia data if Atlanta Fed has updated)

## Key Results Summary

### TABLE 1: Baseline Models (Full Sample: Jan 1950 – Jan 2025)

| Variable | Model 1 | Model 2 | Model 3 |
|----------|---------|---------|---------|
| UNRATE (total) | 0.20* | — | — |
| | (0.09) | | |
| UNRATE_anticipated | — | 0.22* | 0.17† |
| | | (0.09) | (0.10) |
| UNRATE_unanticipated | — | -0.02 | -0.04 |
| | | (0.19) | (0.19) |
| VIX | — | — | -0.12*** |
| | | | (0.02) |
| **R²** | 0.004 | 0.007 | 0.405 |
| **N** | 901 | 886 | 421 |

*Notes: Standard errors in parentheses. HC1 robust SEs used.*  
*† p < 0.10, \* p < 0.05, \*\* p < 0.01, \*\*\* p < 0.001*

**Interpretation:**

- Anticipated unemployment explains <1% of return variation alone
- VIX dominates: explains 40% of variation
- Post-1990 markets primarily driven by volatility, not labor market fundamentals

### TABLE 2: Structural Break Test (December 2014)

| | Pre-2014 | Post-2014 |
|---|----------|-----------|
| β_anticipated | 0.22* | 0.40† |
| p-value | 0.017 | 0.087 |
| N | 779 | 128 |
| **Chow F-statistic** | **1.22** | |
| **Chow p-value** | **0.30** | |

*Notes: Cannot reject parameter stability despite coefficient difference. Rolling windows show extreme instability (CV=98%), suggesting continuous drift rather than discrete structural break.*

### TABLE 3: Out-of-Sample Prediction Performance

| Specification | OOS R² |
|---------------|--------|
| Naive (historical mean) | 0.00% |
| Unemployment only | -0.66% |
| With VIX | +15.2% |

*Notes: Expanding window forecasts (1990-2025). Negative OOS R² indicates unemployment performs worse than simply predicting the historical mean.*

## Interpretation and Implications

### Main Conclusion

Unemployment has statistically significant but economically trivial predictive power for stock returns. This relationship is pervasively unstable over time and dominated by market volatility (VIX). Post-1990 equity markets appear increasingly decoupled from traditional labor market fundamentals.

### Theoretical Implications

1. **Boyd et al. (2005) mechanism confirmed:** Bad unemployment news can be good for stocks, potentially reflecting anticipated Fed easing.
   
2. **Fed Put evidence is weak:** Policy interaction terms are statistically insignificant, but low power (23%) prevents definitive conclusions.
   
3. **Financialization hypothesis supported:** VIX dominance suggests equity markets have become self-referential, responding more to volatility regime shifts than macroeconomic fundamentals.

### Practical Implications

- Unemployment data have zero value for equity forecasting (negative OOS R²)
- Investors should focus on volatility measures (VIX) rather than labor market indicators when predicting S&P 500 returns
- Policymakers: Stock market reactions to unemployment data may not reflect rational assessment of economic fundamentals

### Limitations

- Observational data cannot identify causal mechanisms (Fed Put vs. discount rate channels)
- Linear models may miss nonlinear relationships captured by ML methods (Gu et al., 2020 achieve OOS R² up to 1.8% with neural networks)
- Monthly frequency may miss high-frequency market responses to unemployment announcements

## Final Note

This project represents a semester-long investigation into a classic financial economics puzzle. The analysis prioritizes methodological rigor, transparency, and reproducibility. The finding that unemployment has minimal predictive power for stock returns is itself scientifically valuable, as it refutes a commonly held belief and demonstrates the dominance of volatility-based explanations in modern equity markets.
